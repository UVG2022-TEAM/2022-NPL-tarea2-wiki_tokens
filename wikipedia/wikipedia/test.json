{"text": "\n\n\n7 World Trade Center  ( 7 WTC ,  WTC-7 , or  Tower 7 ) refers to two buildings that have existed at the same location within the  World Trade Center site  in  Lower Manhattan ,  New York City . The original structure, part of the  original World Trade Center , was completed in 1987 and was destroyed in the  September 11 attacks  in 2001. The current structure opened in May 2006. Both buildings were developed by  Larry Silverstein , who holds a  ground lease  for the site from the  Port Authority of New York and New Jersey .\nThe original  7 World  Trade Center was  47 stories  tall, clad in red granite masonry, and occupied a  trapezoidal  footprint. An elevated walkway spanning  Vesey Street  connected the building to the World Trade Center plaza. The building was situated above a  Consolidated Edison  power substation, which imposed unique structural design constraints. When the building opened in 1987, Silverstein had difficulties attracting tenants.  Salomon Brothers  signed a long-term lease in 1988 and became the anchor tenant of  7 WTC .\nOn September 11, 2001, the structure was substantially damaged by debris when the nearby North Tower of the World Trade Center  collapsed . The debris ignited fires on multiple lower floors of the building, which continued to burn uncontrolled throughout the afternoon. The building's internal fire suppression system lacked water pressure to fight the fires. The collapse began when a critical internal column buckled and triggered  cascading failure  of nearby columns throughout, which was first visible from the exterior with the crumbling of a rooftop penthouse structure at 5:20:33\u00a0pm. This initiated  progressive collapse  of the entire building at  5:21:10 pm , according to  FEMA , [5] :\u200a23\u200a  while the 2008 NIST study placed the final collapse time at  5:20:52 pm . [6] :\u200a19,\u200a21,\u200a50\u201351\u200a  The collapse made the old 7 World Trade Center the first steel skyscraper known to have collapsed primarily due to uncontrolled fires. [7] [8] \nConstruction of the new  7 World  Trade Center began in 2002 and was completed in 2006. The building is  52 stories  tall (plus one underground floor), making it the 28th-tallest in New York. [2] [3] [4]  It is built on a smaller footprint than the original, and is bounded by Greenwich,  Vesey ,  Washington , and Barclay Streets on the east, south, west, and north, respectively. A small park across Greenwich Street occupies space that was part of the original building's footprint. The current building's design emphasizes safety, with a  reinforced concrete  core, wider stairways, and thicker fireproofing on steel columns. It also incorporates numerous  green design  features. The building was the first commercial office building in New York City to receive the U.S. Green Building Council's  Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design  (LEED) certification, where it won a gold rating. It was also one of the first projects accepted to be part of the Council's pilot program for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design \u2013 Core and Shell Development (LEED-CS). [9] \nThe original 7\u00a0World Trade Center was a 47-story building, designed by  Emery Roth & Sons , with a red  granite  facade. The building was 610 feet (190\u00a0m) tall, with a  trapezoidal  footprint that was 330\u00a0ft (100\u00a0m) long and 140\u00a0ft (43\u00a0m) wide. [10] [11]   Tishman Realty & Construction  managed construction of the building. [10]  The ground-breaking ceremony was hosted on October 2, 1984. [12]  The building opened in May 1987, becoming the seventh structure of the  World Trade Center . [13] \n7 World Trade Center was constructed above a two-story  Con Edison   substation  that had been located on the site since 1967. [14] [12]  The substation had a  caisson  foundation designed to carry the weight of a future building of 25\u00a0stories containing 600,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (56,000\u00a0m 2 ). [15]  However, the final design for 7\u00a0World Trade Center was for a much larger building than originally planned when the substation was built. [16] :\u200axxxviii\u200a  The structural design of 7\u00a0World Trade Center therefore included a system of gravity column transfer trusses and girders, located between floors\u00a05 and 7, to transfer loads to the smaller foundation. [6] :\u200a5\u200a  Existing caissons installed in 1967 were used, along with new ones, to accommodate the building. The 5th floor functioned as a structural diaphragm, providing lateral stability and distribution of loads between the new and old caissons. Above the 7th floor,  the building's structure was a typical  tube-frame  design, with columns in the core and on the perimeter, and lateral loads resisted by perimeter moment frames. [15] \nA shipping and receiving ramp, which served the entire World Trade Center complex, occupied the eastern quarter of the 7\u00a0World Trade Center footprint. The building was open below the 3rd floor, providing space for truck clearance on the shipping ramp. [15]  The spray-on  fireproofing  for structural steel elements was  gypsum -based  Monokote , which had a two-hour fire rating for steel beams, girders and trusses, and a three-hour rating for columns. [5] :\u200a11\u200a \nMechanical equipment was installed on floors four through seven, including 12\u00a0 transformers  on the 5th floor. Several  emergency generators  installed in the building were used by the  New York City Office of Emergency Management ,  Salomon Smith Barney , and other tenants. [5] :\u200a13\u200a  In order to supply the generators, 24,000\u00a0gallons (91,000\u00a0L) of  diesel fuel  were stored below ground level. [17]  Diesel fuel distribution components were located at ground level, up to the ninth floor. [18] :\u200a35\u200a  After the  World Trade Center bombings  of February 26, 1993, New York City mayor  Rudy Giuliani  decided to situate the emergency command center and associated fuel tanks at 7\u00a0World Trade Center. Although this decision was criticized in light of the events of  9/11 , the fuel in the building is today not believed to have contributed to the collapse of the building. [19] [20] :\u200a2\u200a  The roof of the building included a small west penthouse and a larger east mechanical penthouse. [14] \nEach floor had 47,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (4,400\u00a0m 2 ) of rentable office space, which made the building's floor plans considerably larger than most office buildings in the city. [21]  In all, 7\u00a0World Trade Center had 1,868,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (173,500\u00a0m 2 ) of office space. [5] :\u200a1\u200a  Two pedestrian bridges connected the main World Trade Center complex, across Vesey Street, to the third floor of 7\u00a0World Trade Center. The lobby of 7\u00a0World Trade Center held three murals by artist  Al Held :  The Third Circle ,  Pan North XII , and  Vorces VII . [22] \nIn June 1986, before construction was completed, developer  Larry Silverstein  signed  Drexel Burnham Lambert  as a tenant to lease the entire 7\u00a0World Trade Center building for $3\u00a0billion over a term of 30\u00a0years. [23] \nIn December 1986, after the  Boesky   insider-trading  scandal, Drexel Burnham Lambert canceled the lease, leaving Silverstein to find other tenants. [24] \nSpicer & Oppenheim agreed to lease 14\u00a0percent of the space, but for more than a year, as  Black Monday  and other factors adversely affected the  Lower Manhattan  real estate market, Silverstein was unable to find tenants for the remaining space. By April 1988, he had lowered the rent and made other concessions. [25] \nIn November 1988, Salomon Brothers withdrew from plans to build a large new complex at  Columbus Circle  in  Midtown , instead agreeing to a 20-year lease for the top 19 floors of 7\u00a0World Trade Center. [26]  The building was extensively renovated in 1989 to accommodate Salomon Brothers, and 7\u00a0World Trade Center alternatively became known as the Salomon Brothers building. [27]  Most of the three existing floors were removed as tenants continued to occupy other stories, and more than 350\u00a0tons (U.S.) of steel were added to construct three double-height trading floors. Nine diesel generators were installed on the 5th floor as part of a backup power station. \"Essentially, Salomon is constructing a building within a building \u2013 and it's an occupied building, which complicates the situation\", said a district manager of  Silverstein Properties . [27]  According to Larry Silverstein, the unusual task was possible because it could allow \"entire portions of floors to be removed without affecting the building's structural integrity, on the assumption that someone might need double-height floors.\" [27] \nAt the time of the September 11, 2001, attacks, Salomon Smith Barney was by far the largest tenant in 7\u00a0World Trade Center, occupying 1,202,900\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (111,750\u00a0m 2 ) (64\u00a0percent of the building) which included floors 28\u201345. [5] :\u200a2\u200a [28]  Other major tenants included  ITT Hartford Insurance Group  (122,590\u00a0sq\u00a0ft/11,400\u00a0m 2 ),  American Express  Bank International (106,117\u00a0sq\u00a0ft/9,900\u00a0m 2 ),  Standard Chartered Bank  (111,398\u00a0sq\u00a0ft/10,350\u00a0m 2 ), and the  Securities and Exchange Commission  (106,117\u00a0sq\u00a0ft/9,850\u00a0m 2 ). [28]  Smaller tenants included the  Internal Revenue Service  Regional Council (90,430\u00a0sq\u00a0ft/8,400\u00a0m 2 ) and the  United States Secret Service  (85,343\u00a0sq\u00a0ft/7,900\u00a0m 2 ). [28]  The smallest tenants included the  New York City Office of Emergency Management , [29]   National Association of Insurance Commissioners ,  Federal Home Loan Bank  of New York, First State Management Group Inc.,  Provident Financial Management , and the  Immigration and Naturalization Service . [28]  The  Department of Defense  (DOD) and  Central Intelligence Agency  (CIA) shared the 25th floor with the IRS. [5] :\u200a2\u200a  (The clandestine CIA office was revealed only after the 9/11 attacks.) [30]   Floors 46\u201347 were  mechanical floors , as were the bottom six floors and part of the seventh floor. [5] :\u200a2\u200a [30] \nAs the North Tower collapsed on September 11, 2001, heavy debris hit 7\u00a0World Trade Center, damaging the south face of the building [31] :\u200a18 (PDF p. 22)\u200a  and starting fires that continued to burn throughout the afternoon. [6] :\u200a16,\u200a18\u200a  The collapse also caused damage to the southwest corner between floors 7 and 17 and on the south face between Floor 44 and the roof; other possible structural damage included a large vertical gash near the center of the south face between Floors 24 and 41. [6] :\u200a17\u200a  The building was equipped with a  sprinkler system , but had many single-point vulnerabilities for failure: the sprinkler system required manual initiation of the electrical fire pumps, rather than being a fully automatic system; the floor-level controls had a single connection to the sprinkler water riser, and the sprinkler system required some power for the  fire pump  to deliver water. [32] :\u200a11\u200a  Additionally, water pressure was low, with little or no water to feed sprinklers. [33] :\u200a23\u201330\u200a \nAfter the North Tower collapsed, some firefighters entered 7\u00a0World Trade Center to search the building. They attempted to extinguish small pockets of fire, but low water pressure hindered their efforts. [34]  Over the course of the day, fires burned out of control on several floors of 7 World Trade Center, the flames visible on the east side of the building. [35]  During the afternoon, the fire was also seen on floors 6\u201310, 13\u201314, 19\u201322, and 29\u201330. [31] :\u200a24 (PDF p. 28)\u200a  In particular, the fires on floors 7 through 9 and 11 through 13 continued to burn out of control during the afternoon. [7]  At approximately 2:00\u00a0pm, firefighters noticed a bulge in the southwest corner of 7\u00a0World Trade Center between the 10th and 13th floors, a sign that the building was unstable and might collapse. [36]  During the afternoon, firefighters also heard creaking sounds coming from the building. [37]  Around 3:30\u00a0pm, FDNY Chief of Operations  Daniel A. Nigro  decided to halt rescue operations, surface removal, and searches along the surface of the debris near 7\u00a0World Trade Center and evacuate the area due to concerns for the safety of personnel. [38]  The fire expanded the girders of the building, causing some to lose their structural integrity. This led column number 79, a critical column supporting a large part of the 13th floor, to buckle, causing the floors above it to collapse to the fifth floor; however, this could not be seen from outside the building. The structure also developed cracks in the facade just before the entire building started to fall. [6] :\u200a21\u200a [39]  According to FEMA, this collapse started at 5:20:33\u00a0pm EDT when the east mechanical penthouse started crumbling. [5] :\u200a23\u200a [40]  Differing times are given as to what time the building completely collapsed: [40]  at 5:21:10\u00a0pm EDT according to FEMA, [5] :\u200a23\u200a  and at 5:20:52\u00a0pm EDT according to NIST. [6] :\u200a19,\u200a21,\u200a50\u201351\u200a  There were no  casualties  associated with the collapse. [39]  NIST found no evidence to support  conspiracy theories  such as the collapse being the result of explosives; it found that a combination of factors including physical damage, fire, and the building's unusual construction set off a chain-reaction collapse. [41] \nIn May 2002, the  Federal Emergency Management Agency  (FEMA) issued a report on the collapse based on a preliminary investigation conducted jointly with the Structural Engineering Institute of the  American Society of Civil Engineers  under the leadership of Dr.  W. Gene Corley , P.E. FEMA made preliminary findings that the collapse was not primarily caused by actual impact damage from the collapse of 1\u00a0WTC and 2\u00a0WTC but by fires on multiple stories ignited by debris from the other two towers that continued burning unabated due to lack of water for sprinklers or manual firefighting. The report did not reach conclusions about the cause of the collapse and called for further investigation. [20] :\u200a3\u200a \nSubsequently, the  National Institute of Standards and Technology  (NIST)  was authorized  to lead an investigation into the structural failure and  collapse of the World Trade Center  Twin Towers and 7\u00a0World Trade Center. [7]  The investigation, led by Dr S. Shyam Sunder, drew upon in-house technical expertise as well as the knowledge of several outside private institutions, including the Structural Engineering Institute of the  American Society of Civil Engineers  (SEI/ASCE); the  Society of Fire Protection Engineers  (SFPE); the  National Fire Protection Association  (NFPA); the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC); the  Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat  (CTBUH); and the  Structural Engineers Association of New York  (SEAoNY). [42] \n\nThe bulk of the investigation of 7 World Trade Center was delayed until after reports were completed on the Twin Towers. [7]  In the meantime, NIST provided a preliminary report about 7 WTC in June 2004, and thereafter released occasional updates on the investigation. [31]  According to NIST, the investigation of 7\u00a0World Trade Center was delayed for a number of reasons, including that NIST staff who had been working on 7\u00a0World Trade Center were assigned full-time from June 2004 to September 2005 to work on the investigation of the collapse of the Twin Towers. [43]  In June 2007, Shyam Sunder explained, In November 2008, NIST released its final report on the causes of the collapse of 7\u00a0World Trade Center. [6]  This followed NIST's August 21, 2008, draft report which included a period for public comments, [7]  and was followed in 2012 by a peer-reviewed summary in the  Journal of Structural Engineering . [45]  In its investigation, NIST utilized  ANSYS  to model events leading up to collapse initiation and  LS-DYNA  models to simulate the global response to the initiating events. [46] :\u200a6\u20137\u200a  NIST determined that diesel fuel did not play an important role, nor did the structural damage from the collapse of the Twin Towers or the transfer elements (trusses, girders, and cantilever overhangs). The lack of water to fight the fire was an important factor. The fires burned out of control during the afternoon, causing floor beams near column 79 to expand and push a key girder off its seat, triggering the floors to fail around column 79 on Floors 8 to 14. With a loss of lateral support across nine floors, column 79 buckled \u2013 pulling the east penthouse and nearby columns down with it. With the buckling of these critical columns, the collapse then progressed east-to-west across the core, ultimately overloading the perimeter support, which buckled between Floors 7 and 17, causing the remaining portion of the building above to fall down as a single unit. The fires, which were fueled by office contents and burned for 7 hours, along with the lack of water, were the key reasons for the collapse. [6] :\u200a21\u201322\u200a  At the time, this made the old 7 WTC the only steel skyscraper to have collapsed from fire. [8] \nWhen 7\u00a0WTC collapsed, debris caused substantial damage and contamination to the  Borough of Manhattan Community College 's  Fiterman Hall  building, located adjacent at 30\u00a0West Broadway, to the extent that the building was not salvageable. [47]  A revised plan called for demolition in 2009 and completion of the new Fiterman Hall in 2012, at a cost of $325\u00a0million. [48]  The  Verizon Building , an  art deco  building located directly to the west, had extensive damage to its eastern facade from the collapse of 7\u00a0World Trade Center, though it was later restored at a cost of US$1.4\u00a0billion. [49] \nFiles relating to numerous federal investigations had been housed in 7 World Trade Center. The  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  estimated over 10,000 of its cases were affected. [50]  Investigative files in the Secret Service's largest field office were lost, with one Secret Service agent saying, \"All the evidence that we stored at 7 World Trade, in all our cases, went down with the building.\" [51]  Copies of emails in connection with the  WorldCom scandal  that were later requested by the  SEC  from  Salomon Brothers , a subsidiary of  Citigroup  housed in the building, were also destroyed. [52] \nThe NIST report found no evidence supporting the conspiracy theories that 7 World Trade Center was brought down by controlled demolition. Specifically, the window breakage pattern and blast sounds that would have resulted from the use of explosives were not observed. [6] :\u200a26\u201328\u200a  The suggestion that an incendiary material such as  thermite  was used instead of explosives was considered unlikely by NIST because of the building's structural response to the fire, the nature of the fire, and the unlikelihood that a sufficient amount of thermite could be planted without discovery. [7]  Based on its investigation, NIST reiterated several recommendations it had made in its earlier report on the collapse of the Twin Towers. [6] :\u200a63\u201373\u200a  It urged immediate action on a further recommendation: that fire resistance should be evaluated under the assumption that sprinklers are unavailable; [6] :\u200a65\u201366\u200a  and that the effects of thermal expansion on floor support systems be considered. [6] :\u200a65,\u200a69\u200a   Recognizing that current building codes are drawn to prevent loss of life rather than building collapse, the main point of NIST's recommendations was that buildings should not collapse from fire even if sprinklers are unavailable. [6] :\u200a63\u201373\u200a \nThe new 7\u00a0World Trade Center has 52\u00a0stories and is 741\u00a0ft (226\u00a0m) tall. [53]  The building has 42\u00a0floors of leasable space, starting at the 11th floor, and a total of 1.7\u00a0million\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (160,000\u00a0m 2 ) of office space. [54]  The first ten floors house an electrical substation which provides power to much of Lower Manhattan. The office tower has a narrower footprint at ground level than did its predecessor, so the course of Greenwich Street could be restored to reunite  TriBeCa  and the  Financial District . The original building, on the other hand, had bordered West Broadway on the east, necessitating the destruction of Greenwich Street between Barclay Street and the northern border of the World Trade Center superblock. [55] \nDavid Childs  of  Skidmore, Owings and Merrill  worked in conjunction with glass artist and designer James Carpenter to create a design that uses ultra-clear, low-iron glass to provide reflectivity and light, with stainless-steel  spandrels  behind the glass to help reflect sunlight. [56]  Stainless steel used in the building fa\u00e7ade is  molybdenum -containing Type\u00a0316, which provides improved resistance to corrosion. [57]  To enclose the power substation and improve its aesthetics, the base of the building has a curtain wall with  stainless steel   louvers  that provide ventilation for the machinery. [58]  During the day, the curtain wall reflects light, while at night it is illuminated with blue  LED  lights. [59]  The curtain wall around the lobby uses heavily laminated, heat-strengthened glass that meets high standards for blast resistance. [60]  At night, a large cube of light above the lobby also emanates blue light, while during the day it provides white light to the lobby, and at dusk, it transitions to violet and back to blue. [61]  Inside the main lobby, artist  Jenny Holzer  created a large light installation with glowing text moving across wide plastic panels. [56]  The entire wall, which is 65\u00a0ft (20\u00a0m) wide and 14\u00a0ft (4.3\u00a0m) tall, changes color according to the time of day. Holzer worked with Klara Silverstein, the wife of Larry Silverstein, to select poetry for the art installation. The wall is structurally fortified as a security measure. [62] \nThe building is being promoted as the safest skyscraper in the U.S. [63]  According to Silverstein Properties, the owner of the building, it \"incorporate[s] a host of life-safety enhancements that will become the prototype for new high-rise construction.\" [64]  The building has 2-foot-thick (0.61\u00a0m)  reinforced-concrete  and  fireproofed  elevator and stairway access shafts. The original building used only  drywall  to line these shafts. [65]  The stairways are wider than in the original building to permit faster egress. [65] \n7 World Trade Center is equipped with  Otis   destination elevators . [66]  After pressing a destination floor number on a lobby keypad, passengers are grouped and directed to specific elevators that will stop at the selected floor (there are no buttons to press inside the elevators). This system is designed to reduce elevator waiting and travel times. The elevator system is integrated with the lobby turnstile and card reader system that identifies the floor on which a person works as he or she enters and can automatically call the elevator for that floor. [67] \nNearly 30 percent of structural steel used in the building consists of recycled steel. [68]  Rainwater is collected and used for irrigation of the park and to cool the building. [56]  Along with other sustainable design features, the building is designed to allow in plenty of natural light, power is metered to tenants to encourage them to conserve energy, the heating steam is reused to generate some power for the building, and recycled materials are used for insulation and interior materials. [69] \nThe construction phase of the new 7 World Trade Center began on May 7, 2002, with the installation of a fence around the construction site. [1]  Tishman Construction Corporation of New York began work at the new 7\u00a0World Trade Center in 2002, soon after the site was cleared of debris. Restoring the Con Ed  electrical substation  was an urgent priority to meet power demands of Lower Manhattan. [55]  Because 7\u00a0World Trade Center is separate from the main 16-acre (6.5\u00a0ha)  World Trade Center site ,  Larry Silverstein  required approval from only the  Port Authority , and rebuilding was able to proceed quickly. [70]  Building Seven was not included in the original World Trade Center master plan by  Daniel Libeskind , but was designed by  Skidmore, Owings & Merrill  under the leadership of  David Childs , who largely redesigned  One World Trade Center .\nOnce construction of the power substation was completed in October 2003, work proceeded on building the office tower. An unusual approach was used in constructing the building; erecting the steel frame before adding the concrete core. This approach allowed the construction schedule to be shortened by a few months. [71]  Construction was completed in 2006 at a cost of $700\u00a0million. [56]  Though Silverstein received $861\u00a0million from insurance on the old building, he owed more than $400\u00a0million on its mortgage. [72]  Costs to rebuild were covered by $475\u00a0million in  Liberty Bonds , which provide tax-exempt financing to help stimulate rebuilding in Lower Manhattan and insurance money that remained after other expenses. [73] \nA 15,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (1,400\u00a0m 2 ) triangular park was created between the extended Greenwich Street and West Broadway by David Childs with Ken Smith and his colleague, Annie Weinmayr, of Ken Smith Landscape Architect. The park comprises an open central plaza with a fountain and flanking groves of  sweetgum  trees and  boxwood  shrubs. [74]  At the center of the fountain, sculptor  Jeff Koons  created  Balloon Flower (Red) , whose mirror-polished stainless steel represents a twisted balloon in the shape of a flower. [75] \nThe building was officially opened at noon on May 23, 2006, with a free concert featuring  Suzanne Vega ,  Citizen Cope , Bill Ware Vibes,  Brazilian Girls ,  Ollabelle ,  Pharaoh's Daughter ,  Ronan Tynan  (of the  Irish Tenors ), and special guest  Lou Reed . [76] [77]  Prior to opening, in March 2006, the new 7\u00a0World Trade Center frontage and lobby were used in scenes for the movie  Perfect Stranger  with  Halle Berry  and  Bruce Willis . [78] \nSince the building opened, several unleased upper floors have been used for events such as charity lunches, fashion shows, and black-tie galas. Silverstein Properties allowed space in the new building to be used for these events as a means to draw people to see the building. [79]  From September 8 to October 7, 2006, the work of photographer Jonathan Hyman was displayed in \"An American Landscape\", a free exhibit hosted by the  World Trade Center Memorial Foundation  at 7\u00a0World Trade Center. The photographs captured the response of people in New York City and across the United States after the September 11, 2001, attacks. The exhibit took place on the 45th floor while space remained available for lease. [80] \nBy March 2007, 60\u00a0percent of the building had been leased. [81]  In September 2006,  Moody's  signed a 20-year lease to rent 15\u00a0floors of 7\u00a0World Trade Center. [82]  Other tenants that had signed leases in 7\u00a0World Trade Center, as of May 2007, included  ABN AMRO , [83]   Ameriprise Financial  Inc., [84] [77]  law firm  WilmerHale , Darby & Darby P.C., [85]  Mansueto Ventures LLC, business publisher of  Fast Company  and  Inc. , [86]  and the  New York Academy of Sciences . [87] [77] \nThe space occupied by  Mansueto Ventures  has been designed to use the maximum amount of natural light and has an open floor plan.

{"text": "\nBelton House  is a  Grade I  listed  country house  in the parish of  Belton  near  Grantham  in  Lincolnshire ,  England , built between 1685 and 1688 by  Sir John Brownlow, 3rd Baronet . It is surrounded by formal gardens and a series of avenues leading to  follies  within a larger wooded  park . Belton has been described as a compilation of all that is finest of  Carolean  architecture, the only truly  vernacular  style of architecture that England had produced since the  Tudor period . [1]  It is considered to be a complete example of a typical English country house. [2] [3] \nFor about three centuries until 1984, Belton House was the seat successively of the  Brownlow family , which had first acquired land in the area in the late 16th century, and of its heirs the  Cust family  (in 1815 created  Earl Brownlow ). Despite his great wealth Sir John Brownlow, 3rd Baronet, chose to build a comparatively modest house rather than one of the grand  Baroque  palaces being built by others at the time. The contemporary, if provincial, Carolean style was the selected choice of design. The new house was fitted with the latest  innovations  such as  sash windows [4]  for the principal rooms, and more significantly, with completely separate areas for the staff. Successive generations made changes to the interior of the house which reflected their changing social position and tastes, yet the fabric and design of the house changed little.\nFollowing  World War I , [5]  the Custs, like many previously wealthy English families, were faced with mounting financial problems and finally in 1984 they donated the house, with most of its contents, to the  National Trust , which now opens Belton to the public. \nThe Brownlow family, a dynasty of  lawyers , began accumulating land in the Belton area from approximately 1598. [6]  In 1609 they acquired the  reversion  of the  manor  of Belton itself from the Pakenham family, who finally sold the manor house to Sir John Brownlow I in 1619. [7]   King James  had stayed a night as a guest of Sir Henry Pakenham in the old house in March 1617 on his way to Scotland. [8]  The old house was situated near the church in the garden of the present house and remained largely unoccupied, since the family preferred their other houses elsewhere. John Brownlow had married an heiress but was childless. He became attached to two of his more distant blood relations: a great-nephew, also called John Brownlow, and a great-niece, Alice Sherard. The two cousins married each other in 1676 when both were aged 16; [9]  three years later, the couple inherited the Brownlow estates from their great-uncle together with an income of \u00a39,000 per annum (about \u00a31.46\u00a0million in present-day terms) and \u00a320,000 in cash (equivalent to about \u00a33.26\u00a0million now). [10]  They immediately bought a  town house  in the newly fashionable  Southampton Square  in  Bloomsbury , and decided to build a new country house at Belton. [11] \nWork on the new house began in 1685. The architect thought to have been responsible for the initial design is  William Winde , although the house has also been attributed to Sir  Christopher Wren , while others believe the design to be so similar to  Roger Pratt 's  Clarendon House , London, that it could have been the work of any talented draughtsman. [12]  The assumption popular today, that Winde was the architect, is based on the stylistic similarity between Belton and  Coombe Abbey , which was remodelled by Winde between 1682 and 1685. Further evidence is a letter dated 1690, in which Winde recommends a  plasterer  who worked at Belton to another of his patrons. [13] \nWhoever the architect, Belton follows closely the design of Clarendon House, completed in 1667. [1]  This great London  town house  (demolished c. 1683) has been one of the most admired buildings of its era due to \"its elegant symmetry and confident and common-sensical design\". [15]  Sir  John Summerson  described Clarendon House as \"the most influential house of its time among those who aimed at the grand manner\" and Belton as \"much the finest surviving example of its class\". [1]  John and Alice Brownlow assembled one of the finest teams of craftsmen available at the time to work on the project. This dream team was headed by the master  mason   William Stanton  who oversaw the project. His second in command, John Thompson, had worked with Sir Christopher Wren on several of the latter's London churches, while the chief  joiner  John Sturges had worked at  Chatsworth  under  William Talman . The  wrought-ironworker  John Warren worked under Stanton at  Denham Place ,  Buckinghamshire , and the fine wrought iron gates and  overthrow  at Belton may be his. [16]  Thus so competent were the builders of Belton that Winde may have done little more than provide the original plans and drawings, leaving the interpretation to the on-site craftsmen. This theory is further demonstrated by the external appearance of the adjoining stable block. More provincial, and less masterful in proportion, it is known to have been entirely the work of Stanton. [17] \nThe late 17th century in England was a time of great progress in design. Following the austere years of  Commonwealth  rule, a great flourishing and development in both architecture and the arts began after the  restoration of the monarchy  in 1660.  Royalist  exiles and wealthy young men who made the  Grand Tour , returned home with new ideas\u2014often extravagant variations on classical themes. This was, for England, the dawn of the  Baroque  era. The new wave of architects such as Roger Pratt,  John Webb , and Sir  Christopher Wren  were not just building vast edifices in Renaissance-inspired styles, but also transforming existing older houses. Representative of the utilisation of older houses is  Coleshill House  in  Berkshire , where Pratt transformed the medieval, but now redundant, great hall into a classically inspired entrance hall complete with an  imperial staircase . Great Halls were considered redundant now that employers wished to live separately from their servants, and no longer ate with them in a Great Hall. All evidence and odours of cooking and staff were banished from the principal parts of the house. Employers began to live in fine airy rooms, above the ground floor, with privacy from their servants, who were now confined, unless required, to specifically delegated areas\u2014often the ground and uppermost attic floors. This was a period of great social change in British history, and the educated prided themselves on enlightenment and elegance. [18] \nBelton was designed in the restrained almost  Palladian -inspired architecture of the time immediately before the full emergence in England of the ornate Baroque. The general form this architecture took was of severely symmetrical, often rectangular houses, with a  pediment  over the central bays. This almost rigid concept was to influence the design of innumerable houses, including Belton. Later to be known as the  Carolean  style (from \"Carolus,\" the Latin name for the reigning monarch  Charles II ), it was popular with the minor  aristocracy  and  gentry  for both their town and country houses until long after Charles II's death. [19] \nBelton is faced with the local  Ancaster stone , with a lighter  ashlar  from  Ketton  for the  quoining . [20]  The \"H\"-shaped plan was a design which became popular in the late  Elizabethan  period. However, by the late 16th century, domestic architecture had evolved further than the \"one room deep\" ranges of the earlier \"H\" plan houses, such as  Montacute House . The new layout placed rooms back to back, creating a house two rooms deep. This became known as \"double pile\". As at Belton, this permitted rooms to be not just better lit and heated but also better accessed and related to each other, and with the greatest advantage of all\u2014greater privacy. On the construction side, the double room depth allowed the house to be more compact and under one, more easily constructed, roof, thus lowering building costs.\nThe plan of the rooms at Belton was pass\u00e9 for a grand house of its time. Following the Restoration and the influx of European ideas, it had become popular for large houses to follow the continental fashion of a suite of  state rooms  consisting of a  withdrawing room , dressing room, and bedroom proceeding from either side of a central  saloon  or hall. [21]  These rooms were permanently reserved for use by a high ranking guest, such as a visiting monarch. While Belton does have a saloon at its centre,  enfilades  of state rooms of lessening grandeur do not flank it. The possible reason for this unusual layout is that, while the Brownlows possessed great wealth, their title was only a  baronetcy , and their fortune was barely a century old. They would have been regarded as  gentry , not  aristocracy . As a result, building a suite of state rooms would have been in hope rather than anticipation of a royal guest. However, the lack of a fashionable and formal suite of  state apartments  coupled with the Brownlows' lack of social credentials did not prevent a visit from King  William III  to the newly completed house in 1695. The King occupied the \"Best bedchamber\", a large room with an adjoining closet, directly above the saloon, that led directly from the second floor Great Dining Chamber. [22] \nThis design followed the older style of having reception rooms and bedrooms scattered over the two main floors. The layout used followed Roger Pratt's theory that guest and family rooms should be quite separate. [23]  As a consequence of this philosophy, the family occupied the rooms on the first and second floors of the west and east wings, with the state rooms in the centre. The great staircase, designed to be grand and imposing, rose to the east side of the house, and formed part of the guest's state route from the Hall and Saloon on the first floor to the principal dining room and bedroom on the second. [24] \nThe principal entrance hall, reception and family bedrooms were placed on the ground and first floors above a low  semi-basement  containing service rooms. [25]  The two principal entrances to the mansion in the centre of both the north and south facades were accessed by external staircases, originally a single flared flight on the north side and a double staircase on the south, each of which have since been replaced by single broad flights of steps. [26] \nThe second floor has a matching  fenestration , with windows of equal value to those on the first floor below. The very latest innovation,  sash windows , was used on both floors. The semi-basement and  attic  storey used the more old-fashioned  mullioned  and  transomed  windows, indicating the lower status of the occupants of these floors. It was clearly emphasised from without that the two main floors of the house were purely for state and family use, and the staff and service areas were confined to the semi-basement and attic floors. This concept of keeping staff and domestic matters out of sight (when not required) was relatively new and had first been employed by Pratt in the design of  Coleshill House  in Berkshire. The contemporary social commentator of the day  Roger North  lauded back stairs, of which Belton has two examples ( 5  and  14  on plan), as one of the most important inventions of his day. [27] \nThe principal room is the large Marble Hall ( 1 ) at the centre of the south front; this hall is the beginning of a grand procession of rooms, and corresponds to the former Great Parlour or  Saloon  ( 9 ) on the north front. The Marble Hall is flanked by the former Little Parlour ( 11 , now the Tapestry Room) and the Great Staircase ( 2 ), while the Saloon is flanked by two withdrawing rooms ( 8 ,  10 ). The bedrooms are arranged in individual suites on both floors of the two wings ( 3 ,  etc. ) that flank the state centre of the house. The main staircase, set to one side of the Marble Hall, is one of the few things at Belton which is asymmetrically placed. It has a robust plaster-work ceiling incorporating the Brownlow crest by the London plasterer Edward Goudge, \"now looked on as ye best master in England in his profession,\" William Winde reported in 1690. [28] \nBodily and spiritual needs were balanced symmetrically within the mansion: the kitchen ( 16 ) and the chapel ( 7 ) were both large two-storied halls, rising from the semi-basement to the first floor. This design not only provided a great and lofty space, but also allowed the servants to worship in the chapel without leaving the service floor, while their employers would worship from a private gallery, complete with fireplace, overlooking the chapel on the first floor. [29] \nOne of the most  Carolean  features of the house is the  balustrade  and  cupola  surmounting the roof, another element introduced to English architecture by Roger Pratt. The cupola at Belton does not light a lofty domed hall, as is often the case in Europe, but houses a staircase which gives access to a large viewing platform on top of a lead roof, concealed from the ground by the balustrade which tops the more conventional and visible  hipped  roof. From this vantage point, the owners of Belton could admire the perfect symmetry of their avenues and formal gardens spreading from the house. This feature of the house was removed by the architect  James Wyatt  when he modernised the house in the 18th century. [30]  It was restored to its original form in the 1870s by the 3rd Earl Brownlow. [31] \nSome of Belton's many rooms have been altered over the last 300 years both in use and design. One of the principal rooms, the  Marble Hall  ( 1 ), the first of the large reception rooms, serves as an entrance hall from the south entrance, and takes its name from a  chequer board  patterned floor of black and white marble tiles. By the time of Belton's conception, the  great hall  was no longer a place for the household to eat, but intended as a grand entrance to the house. The hall was originally hung with 28 portraits of Kings, Queens, and Emperors, from  William the Conqueror  to  William III , intended to give the house an air of dynastic importance. The less numerous and far newer Brownlow family portraits were originally hung in the Great Dining Room immediately above. [33]  The room is fully panelled, and parts of the panelling contain  lime wood  embellishments attributed to  Grinling Gibbons . [34]  In the early 19th century, this room, and some others, were re-modelled by  Jeffry Wyatville , who in addition to graining and painting the panelling to imitate  oak  installed new doors. [35] \nThe second of the principal reception rooms, the  Saloon  ( 9 ), opens from the Marble Hall. This large panelled room is on an axis to the avenues of the formal north gardens. Originally known as the Great Parlour, this has always been the chief reception room of the house. It retains its original marble fireplace and has an ornate plaster ceiling which is a  Victorian  copy of the original ceiling by the Carolean  plasterer  Edward Goudge. The centrepiece of the room is a large  Aubusson  carpet made in 1839 for the  1st Earl Brownlow . [36] \nEither side of the Saloon are two smaller drawing rooms ( 8 ,  10 ), which would originally have served as private withdrawing rooms from the more public activities which would have taken place in the Marble Hall and Saloon. One of these rooms, now called the  Tyrconnel Room  ( 10 ), was transformed into the principal or state bedroom during the occupancy of  Lord Tyrconnel  in an attempt to create a more fashionable suite of Baroque state rooms on the first floor. After his death in 1754, it became a Billiard Room, until the  3rd Earl Brownlow  had it refurnished more than a century later. Unusually, the floor is painted with the family arms and crest. The date of the floor is not known for certain but the early nineteenth century has been suggested. [37] \nThe final large reception room on the first floor is the  Hondecoeter Room  ( 16 ), so named because of the three huge oil paintings by  Melchior d'Hondecoeter  (1636\u20131695), depicting scenes of birds in courtyards, which are fitted into the neo-Carolean panelling. The panelling was introduced to the room by the 3rd Earl Brownlow in 1876, when it was furnished as the principal dining room of the mansion. The room was initially created as a library in 1808 from the upper part of the earlier kitchen which had originally risen two stories. [38]  The West staircase ( 14 ) was originally a service stairs, and would have been plainer in decor, but by the late nineteenth century it was in regular use by the family. [39] \nEither side of the Marble Hall, lie the  Great Staircase  ( 2 ) and the  Tapestry Room  ( 11 ), which contains a collection of early eighteenth century  Mortlake tapestries . The Great Staircase to the east of the Marble Hall is unusually placed at Belton, as in a house of this period one would expect to find the staircase in the hall. The stairs rise in three flights around the west, north, and east walls to the former Great Dining Room above the Marble Hall. Thus the staircase served as an important state procession link between the three principal reception rooms of the house. The  Great Dining Room , now the Library, has been greatly altered and all traces of Carolean decoration removed, first by  James Wyatt  in 1778 when it was transformed into a drawing room with a vaulted ceiling, and again in 1876, when its use was again changed, this time to a library. The room contains some 6000 volumes, a superb example of book collecting over 350 years. [40]  When Lord Tyrconnel died in 1754 a catalogue of his library identified almost 2,300 books. Almost all of these remain in the Belton library today.  Rupert Gunnis  attributed the carved marble chimneypiece depicting two Roman goddesses to Sir  Richard Westmacott . [41] \nLeading from the Library is the  Queen's Room , the former \"Best Bed Chamber\". This panelled room was redecorated in 1841 for the visit of Queen  Adelaide , widow of  William IV , when its former function as a state bedroom was resurrected. It contains the great canopied  Rococo -style bed in which the Queen slept, complete with the royal  monogram  \"AR\" ( Adelaide Regina )  embroidered  on the bedhead. Other rooms on the second floor are mostly bedrooms, which include the  Chinese Room  (directly above the Tyrconnel Room) with its original hand-painted 18th-century Chinese wallpaper, the  Yellow Room  (directly above the Blue Room), and the  Windsor Bedroom  (directly above the School Room), so-called following its use by King  Edward VIII of the United Kingdom , who became the  Duke of Windsor  after the  abdication crisis of 1936 . Edward visited Belton in the 1930s with his mistress  Wallis Simpson , and the  6th Baron Brownlow  was heavily involved in the crisis thanks to his position as the King's  Lord-in-waiting . [42]  Today, Belton has a permanent exhibition devoted to that event. Another royal visitor,  Charles, Prince of Wales , also used the room frequently while a cadet at nearby  RAF Cranwell . [43] \nIn 1690, Sir John Brownlow was granted permission to enclose an area of 1,000\u00a0 acres  (4\u00a0km 2 ) to transform into a park, with a grant to keep deer. There is evidence to suggest that some of this area had been a park since at least 1580. The park was laid out with avenues, including the still surviving Eastern Avenue which led east from the house. Brownlow also had a large pond or lake dug and planted 21,400 ash trees, 9,500 oak trees, and 614 fruit trees. It is thought that William Winde may have advised on the layout of the gardens. [44]  Closer to the house were a series of more formal gardens, including canal ponds bordered by plantations containing symmetrical walks resembling the \"rond-points\" (circular clearings in a garden from which straight paths radiate) introduced by the landscape gardener  Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre . By the end of the eighteenth century, these formal  parterres  had been removed and the canal ponds filled in. [45] \nSir John Brownlow was succeeded at Belton by his brother, who was content to permit Brownlow's widow, Alice, to remain in occupation. She spent the remainder of her life at Belton arranging advantageous marriages for her five daughters. [46]  On her death in 1721, the house passed to her husband's nephew (and her son-in-law)  Sir John Brownlow III (later Viscount Tyrconnel) . Tyrconnel, a dilettante of no great intellect, [47]  was responsible for many of the architectural features which survive in the park and garden. Between 1742 and 1751, a series of  follies , including a  Gothic  ruin, a cascade, and a prospect or  belvedere  known as the Belmount Tower, were constructed for him. When built the tower had two small wings flanking each side, since removed. [48] \nJohn Cust, 1st Earl Brownlow , owner of Belton House from 1807 to 1853, commissioned the architect  Anthony Salvin  to undertake improvements to the Estate in 1838. Salvin's additions included a  public house , estate cottages, a hermitage and  the boathouse . [49] \nIn 1754, Belton was inherited by  Sir John Cust , the son of previous owner Viscount Tyrconnel's widowed sister. Cust was a distinguished politician active during the politically turbulent 1760s, and his monument at Belton blames his death at the age of 51 to the \"unusual fatigues of his office\". [50]   His heir  was created Lord Brownlow in 1776, and Belton was owned by successive Lords Brownlow for the next 200 years. [51] \nIn the last three decades of the 19th century the 3rd Earl Brownlow spent much time and money restoring Belton, [52]  and consequently the house entered the 20th century in a good state of repair and preservation. However, the 20th century was to present Belton and its estate with serious problems. These included the introduction of  income tax  and  death duties  which would leave the finances of the Brownlow family severely depleted. [53] \nAt the beginning of  World War I , like many other British landowners, the 3rd Earl Brownlow offered his house and park to the Government for war service. The offer was accepted, and the largest and most drastic changes were made in the park since the time of Viscount Tyrconnel's folly building. In August 1914, the house and park were used as the assembly point for the  11th (Northern) Division  before its deployment. In 1915, the home dep\u00f4t and training ground of the  Machine Gun Corps  were established in the southern part of Belton park. [54]  The lie of the land there, where the  River Witham  passes between the  Lower Lincolnshire Limestone  and the  Upper Lias  mudstone, lent itself to the development of the necessary firing ranges close to good communications by way of the  Great North Road  and  Grantham railway station  on the  East Coast Main Line . The dep\u00f4t was closed in 1919, the site cleared and the land restored to Lord Brownlow in 1920. Little sign of the Machine Gun Corps's stay remains in the park, but plaques and inscriptions can be followed from the south gate of Belton park to the memorial gate on the way from there to the town centre and in the north aisle of Grantham parish church. [55]   This was the subject for an episode of  Time Team ; season 20, episode 01, \" The Forgotten Gunners of WWI \".\nBelton again saw war service during  World War II . From 1942, part of the  Royal Air Force Regiment  was housed in  Nissen huts  at the park in a facility named  RAF Belton Park . [56] \nThe years following World War I were severely testing for the owners of many great estates. The staff both indoor and outdoor, which had previously been plentiful, essential, and cheap, were now in short supply. Millions of men had left private service to join the army, and very few returned. Female domestic staff had been called up for war service in factories, and now realised there was an easier and better paid existence outside of the gates of the great country houses.\nBelton House remained relatively untouched during this period, largely owing to the failing fortunes of the Brownlow family. The 3rd Earl Brownlow and his Countess lived for only a few months of the year at Belton, where they came for the  fox-hunting , and divided the remainder of their time between their house in London and  Ashridge , another country house in  Hertfordshire . Ashridge, a huge  Gothic revival  pile, had come to the Brownlows in the 19th century through the  Egerton family . It was sold, with its art collection and furnishings, to pay the  death duties  arising on the death of the 3rd Earl in 1921. Hence Belton became the Brownlows' sole country home. Further death duties were incurred in 1927 on the death of the 3rd Earl's successor, his second cousin Adelbert Cust, 5th Baron Brownlow. [58] \nIn the ensuing period many thousands of country houses of great architectural value were demolished, or had whole wings razed to the ground. In 1955 alone one house was demolished every five days. [59]  In this respect Belton was fortunate to survive at all, as in addition to the family's problems, the house deteriorated to such an extent that in 1961 the 6th Baron employed the architect  Francis Johnson  to oversee a large restoration program lasting three years. Not only was the roof repaired but much of the panelling taken down and repaired, and new cornices installed. Also attempts were made to curtail serious infestations of  dry rot . [60] \nThe seventh Baron attempted to retain the house and estate by opening to the public. An adventure playground was built in the nearby woods to attract families to the house as a tourist attraction. However, the financial difficulties were too great and in January 1984 he transferred ownership of the house, garden, and some of the contents to the  National Trust , a charitable body experienced in the management of historic properties. An auction of the contents was held at Belton House by Christie's over three days 30 April \u2013 2 May 1984, comprising 1,022 lots. [61]  The National Trust then purchased at a cost of \u00a38 million (worth about \u00a327\u00a0million today) 1,317\u00a0acres (5.3\u00a0km 2 ) of parkland and much of the remaining contents with a grant from the  National Heritage Memorial Fund . [62] \nThe Trust quickly produced a guide book for the 1984 season [63]  and opened to the public. A priority was the establishment of a restaurant, [64]  which would not only augment the estate's income, but also encourage people to spend more time at Belton, and travel greater distances to visit. Though the house, its contents, and outbuildings were in an adequate state of repair at the time of the gift, they have since become part of an ongoing programme of conservation and restoration. At the same time, the National Trust has introduced new features and attractions such as a silver exhibition that displays a collection of silver amassed by the Brownlow family, dating from 1698. [65]  Further revenue is raised from the use of the property as a filming location, and from licensing the Marble Hall for civil weddings. [66]  The house features in the BBC's 1988 adaptation of  Moondial . [67]  and also as \"Rosings Park\" in the  BBC 's 1995 television version of  Pride and Prejudice . [68]  It was visited by 460,547 people during 2019. [69] \nUntil its acceptance by the National Trust, Belton House was always in the ownership of the family of its builder, though the failure of three generations to produce a son and heir caused the ownership to pass sideways and sometimes through the female line.\nThe owners of Belton are buried in the village of  Belton 's  parish  church close to the house. Their tombs are collectively one of the most complete sets of family memorials in England\u2014continuous generation to generation for almost 350 years. [12]  The earliest Brownlow buried here is the founder of the family fortune the lawyer  Richard Brownlow  (1555\u20131638), and one of the most recent is the 6th Baron Brownlow (1899\u20131978).\nThe owners of Belton House have been:\nCoordinates :  .mw-parser-output .geo-default,.mw-parser-output .geo-dms,.mw-parser-output .geo-dec{display:inline}.mw-parser-output .geo-nondefault,.mw-parser-output .geo-multi-punct{display:none}.mw-parser-output .longitude,.mw-parser-output .latitude{white-space:nowrap} 52\u00b056\u203235\u2033N   0\u00b037\u203204\u2033W \ufeff / \ufeff 52.9431\u00b0N 0.6178\u00b0W \ufeff /  52.9431; -0.6178 \n\n"},
{"text": "The  Acra  (also spelled  Akra , from  Ancient Greek :  \u1f0c\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1 ,  Hebrew :  \u05d7\u05e7\u05e8\u05d0 ,\u05d7\u05e7\u05e8\u05d4   \u1e24aqra(h) ), with the meaning of \"stronghold\" (see under  \"Etymology\" ), was a place in  Jerusalem  thought to have had a fortified  compound  built by  Antiochus Epiphanes , ruler of the  Seleucid Empire , following his sack of the city in 168\u00a0 BCE . The name Acra was also used at a later time for a city quarter probably associated with the by-then destroyed fortress, known in his time to  Josephus  (1st century CE) as both Acra and \"the lower city\". The fortress played a significant role in the events surrounding the  Maccabean Revolt , which resulted in the formation of the  Hasmonean Kingdom . The \"upper city\" was captured by  Judas Maccabeus , with the Seleucid garrison taking refuge in the \"Acra\" below, [1] [2]  and the task of destroying this last enemy stronghold inside Jerusalem fell to  Simon Maccabeus  surnamed Thassi. [3]  Our knowledge about the Acra is based almost exclusively on the writings of Josephus, which are of a later date, and on the  First  and  Second Books of Maccabees , which were written not long after the described events. [4] [5] [6] [7]  \nThe exact location of Acra within Jerusalem, and even the meaning of the term - fortress, fortified compound inside the city, or compound with an associated fortress - is critical to understanding Hellenistic Jerusalem, but it remains a matter of ongoing discussion. The fact that Josephus has used the name interchangeably with 'the lower city' [8]  certainly doesn't help. Historians and archaeologists have proposed various sites around Jerusalem, relying initially mainly on conclusions drawn from literary evidence. This approach began to change in the light of excavations which commenced in the late 1960s. New discoveries have prompted reassessments of the ancient literary sources, Jerusalem's geography, and previously discovered artifacts. The more recent theories combine archaeological and textual evidence and favour locations near the  Temple Mount  and south of it, [9]  but there are alternative theories as well (see  \"Location\" ). \nThe  ancient Greek  term  acra  was used to describe other fortified structures during the Hellenistic period. The Acra is often called the  Seleucid Acra  to distinguish it from references to the  Ptolemaic Baris  as an  acra  and from the later city quarter of Jerusalem which inherited the name Acra.\nAcra  is the shortened-form of the Greek loanword  akr\u00f3poli , adopted in Aramaic usage and having the connotation of \"citadel\" or \"stronghold\". [10] \nHere are the events leading up to the Maccabean Revolt in which the Acra played an important role, based again mainly on Josephus'  Antiquities of the Jews  and the First and Second Book of Maccabees.\nFollowing  Alexander the Great 's death in 323\u00a0BCE,  Judea  was contested between the  Ptolemaic Kingdom  in Egypt, and the Seleucid Empire based in Syria and Mesopotamia. Seleucid emperor  Antiochus\u00a0III 's victory over Egypt in the  Battle of Panium  brought Judea under Seleucid control. The  Jewish  population of Jerusalem had aided Antiochus during his siege of the Baris, the fortified base of Jerusalem's Egyptian garrison. [11]  Their support was rewarded with a charter affirming Jewish religious autonomy, including barring foreigners and impure animals from the  Temple's precincts , and an allocation of official funds for the maintenance of certain religious rituals in the Temple. [12]  Despite being allowed religious freedom, many Jews were enticed by and adopted elements of the prestigious and influential Greek lifestyle. The imperial culture offered a route to political and material advancement, and this led to the formation of Hellenistic elites among the Jewish population.  Hellenization  produced tensions between observant Jews and their brethren who had assimilated Greek culture. [13] \nAntiochus\u00a0IV Epiphanes  ascended the Seleucid throne in 175\u00a0BCE. Shortly afterward, Epiphanes was petitioned by  Jason  for appointment to the position of  High Priest  of  Israel \u2014an office occupied by his brother  Onias\u00a0III . Jason, himself thoroughly Hellenized, furthermore promised to increase the tribute paid by the city and to establish within it the infrastructure of a Greek  polis , including a  gymnasium  and an  ''ephebion'' . [14]  Jason's petition was granted, yet after a 42-month rule he was ousted by Antiochus and forced to flee to  Ammon . [15] [16]  In the meantime, Antiochus\u00a0IV had launched two invasions of Egypt, in 170\u00a0BCE and again in 169\u00a0BCE, and routed the Ptolemaic armies. [17] [18] [19]  Antiochus' victories were short-lived. His intent to unify the Seleucid and Ptolemaic kingdoms alarmed the rapidly expanding  Roman state , which demanded that he withdraw his forces from Egypt. [19] [20]  With Antiochus engaged in Egypt, a false rumor spread in Jerusalem that he had been killed. In the ensuing uncertainty, Jason gathered a force of 1,000 followers and attempted to take Jerusalem by storm. Although the attack was repulsed, when word of the fighting reached Antiochus in Egypt, he suspected his Judean subjects of exploiting his setback as an opportunity to revolt. In 168\u00a0BCE, Antiochus\u00a0IV Epiphanes marched on and sacked Jerusalem, looting the temple treasury and killing thousands of its residents. [21] [22] [23]  Reversing his father's policy, Antiochus\u00a0IV issued decrees outlawing traditional Jewish rites and persecuting observant Jews. Temple rituals were discontinued, Jewish observance of  Sabbath  prohibited, and  circumcision  outlawed. [24] [25] \nTo consolidate his hold on the city, monitor events on the Temple Mount and safeguard the Hellenized faction in Jerusalem, Antiochus stationed a Seleucid garrison in the city: [26] [27] \nThe name Acra derived from the Greek  acropolis  and signified a lofty fortified place overlooking a town. In Jerusalem, the word came to symbolize anti-Jewish paganism: a fortress of the \"impious and wicked\". [27]  Dominating both the city and the surrounding countryside, it was occupied not only by a Greek garrison but by their Jewish confederates as well. [29] \nThe Seleucid suppression of Jewish religious life met with considerable resistance among the native population. While Antiochus was occupied in the east during 167\u00a0BCE, a rural priest,  Mattathias  of  Modiin , raised a rebellion against the empire. [30]  Both the Seleucid administration and the local Hellenized faction failed to grasp the magnitude of the revolt. In 164\u00a0BCE  Judas Maccabaeus  liberated Jerusalem and reconsecrated the Temple. Although the surrounding city had fallen, the Acra and its inhabitants held out. Maccabaeus besieged the fortress, whose inhabitants sent an appeal to the Seleucid king (now  Antiochus\u00a0V ) for assistance. A Seleucid army was dispatched to put down the revolt. When it laid siege to  Beth-Zur , Maccabaeus was forced to abandon his siege of the Acra and face Antiochus in battle. In the subsequent  Battle of Beth-Zechariah , the Seleucids won their first victory over the  Maccabees , and Maccabaeus was forced to withdraw. [31]  Spared from capitulation, the Acra persisted as a Seleucid stronghold for 20 more years during which it weathered several  Hasmonean  attempts to oust the Greek garrison. [27] [32] \nJudas was killed in 160\u00a0BCE and succeeded by his brother  Jonathan , who attempted to build a barrier to cut off the Acra's supply line. [33]  Jonathan had already assembled the manpower required for the task when he was forced to confront the invading army of Seleucid general  Diodotus Tryphon  at  Beth Shan (Scythopolis) . [34] [35]  Having invited Jonathan to a friendly conference, Tryphon had him seized and murdered. [36]  Jonathan was succeeded by another brother, Simon, who besieged and finally captured the Acra in 141\u00a0BCE. [37] \nTwo sources provide information about the ultimate fate of the Acra, although their accounts are contradictory in places. According to Josephus, Simon razed the Acra after ousting its inhabitants, and then quarried the hill on which it had stood to render it lower than the temple, purge the city of its evil memory and deny it to any future occupier of Jerusalem. [38]  The account appearing in  1 Maccabees  paints a different picture:\nThus in this version, Simon did not immediately demolish the Acra, but instead had it occupied and may even have resided within it himself. 1 Maccabees does not mention its ultimate fate. The fortress had been built as an internal checkpoint to monitor and control Jerusalem and its population. If situated in the  City of David  as most scholars agree, its location would have added very little to Jerusalem's defenses against external threats. It may have fallen out of use and been dismantled around the end of the 2nd century BCE following the construction of the  Hasmonean Baris  and Hasmonean Palace in Jerusalem's upper city. [33] \nBezalel Bar-Kochva  offers a different theory: The Acra was still standing in 139\u00a0BCE when  Antiochus\u00a0VII Sidetes  demanded it back from Simon, along with  Jaffa  and  Gezer , two Hellenized cities Simon had captured. [40] [41]  Simon was willing to discuss the two cities but made no mention of the Acra. [42]  It was at this point that he must have sealed its fate, as a way to deny the Seleucids any future claim or hold on Jerusalem. Thus, when Antiochus\u00a0VII subdued the city during  Hyrcanus I 's reign, each and every one of his demands were met\u2014except the one demanding the stationing of a Seleucid garrison in the city. [43]  Hyrcanus may have been able to reject, and Antiochus to drop, this demand because there was nowhere to billet the garrison, as the Acra would no longer have been standing. This explanation places the razing of the Acra somewhere in the 130s\u00a0BCE. [44] [45] \nJosephus describes Acra, or the \"Lower City\", during the outbreak of the  First Jewish\u2013Roman War . He makes known the internecine struggle between two Jewish factions, the one led by  John of Gischala  who controlled the  Temple Mount  and part of the Lower City, including the  Ophel  and the  Kidron Valley , and the other led by  Simon bar Giora  who controlled all of the \"Upper City\" where he made his place of residence in the  Phasael tower  before abandoning it, [46]  and part of the \"Lower City\" (Acra) as far as the great wall in the Kidron Valley and the  fountain of Siloam . [47] [48]  Eventually, when the Roman army took the Lower City (Acra), they set fire to all its houses. [49]  The palace of the Adiabene  Queen Helena , the proselytess to Judaism, was formerly situated in the middle of Acra. [49] \nThe location of the original fortified structure known as Acra is important for understanding how events unfolded in Jerusalem during the struggle between Maccabean and Seleucid forces. [26] [33]  This has been the subject of debate among modern scholars. [50]  Since the mid-1970s, the search has focused on three areas south of the presumed location of the Second Temple, now marked by the  Dome of the Rock . [9]  These are, from north to south, the area later covered by the Herodian extension of the Temple esplanade; the Ophel; and the entire southeast hill known as the City of David, with a fortress at its northern end. [9] \nComplicating things is the fact that Josephus' Acra can be understood both as the name of a fortified structure and as that of a residential area in Jerusalem during his time, the late  Second Temple period , named after the stronghold. This area he also calls the \"Lower City\", [51] [52] [53] [54] [55]  and corresponds today with parts of  Silwan  including the  City of David  and is distinct from \"the Upper Market\" ( Hebrew :  \u05e9\u05d5\u05e7 \u05d4\u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05d5\u05df ), also known as the \"Upper City\", [51] [56] [57]  as well as from the newer suburb known as  Bezetha  (\"New City\"). [58]  Josephus tells us that the area known as Acra ( Ancient Greek :  \u1f0c\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1 ) was built on a hill in the shape of a horned moon. [59]  The \"Valley of the Cheesemakers\" (the Tyropoeon) separated its hill from the adjacent area known to Josephus as the Upper City. [60] [61] \nThe most detailed ancient description of the nature and location of the Acra is found in Josephus'  Antiquities of the Jews , where it is described as residing in the Lower City, upon a hill overlooking the Temple enclosure:\nThe location of the \"lower part of the city\", elsewhere referred to as the \"Lower City\", at the time of Josephus (1st century CE) is accepted to be Jerusalem's south-eastern hill, the original urban center traditionally known as the City of David. [8]  Lying to the south of the Temple Mount, however, the area exposed today is significantly lower than the Mount itself. The top of the Mount is approximately 30 metres (98\u00a0ft) above the ground level at the southern retaining wall of the later  Herodian-era  expansion of the Temple enclosure. The elevation decreases to the south of this point. [27]  Josephus, a native of Jerusalem, would have been well aware of this discrepancy, yet is nevertheless able to explain it away by describing how Simon had razed both the Acra and the hill on which it had stood. Archaeological research south of the Temple Mount, however, has failed to locate any evidence for such large-scale quarrying. [27]  On the contrary, excavations in the region have uncovered substantial evidence of habitation from the beginning of the first millennium BCE down to Roman times, [63]  casting doubt on the suggestion that during Hellenistic times the area was significantly higher than it was at the time of Josephus or that a large hill had been cleared away. [44]  This had led many researchers to disregard Josephus' account and his placing of the Acra, and suggest several alternate locations. [29]  Since 1841, when  Edward Robinson  proposed the area near the  Church of the Holy Sepulchre  as the site of the Acra, at least nine different locations in and around the  Old City of Jerusalem  have been put forward. [64] [65] \nThe available sources do indicate the Acra stood south of the temple, and because 1 Maccabees is a contemporaneous account of the Maccabean revolt, its account of the Acra (1:35\u201338) is considered the most reliable. [27]  Josephus provides an unlikely account of the razing of a hill on which the Acra had stood, yet his description of the end of the  Great Revolt  (70 CE) provides additional evidence for it being located south of the Temple Mount:\nAs the other buildings mentioned in the account all stood to the south in the Lower City, this also places the Acra there. This account attests to the persistence of the name \"Acra\" in this part of Jerusalem many years after Hellenistic rule ended and its citadels had been overthrown, and it can also be seen as referring not to a distinct building but rather to an entire region of the city. Indeed, several clauses in 1 Maccabees may be read as making a similar point: [67] \nThese suggest that, after the sacking of Jerusalem by Antiochus\u00a0IV in 168\u00a0BCE, at least part of the City of David to the south of the Temple Mount was rebuilt as a fortified Hellenistic quarter of Jerusalem. [27]  More than a citadel, it was a Macedonian colony where Jewish renegades and supporters of the new regime lived. [33]  This is also supported by archaeological evidence, including Rhodian amphorae handles and 18 box graves found on the eastern slope of the City of David. The latter are dated to the early 2nd century CE, and are uncharacteristic of  Second Temple  era Jewish burial practices, yet similar to other known Hellenistic graveyards such as the one in  Acre (Ptolemais) . [65] [70] [71] \nEven if the name \"Acra\" were applied to an entire Hellenistic quarter rather than to just a fortress, it is likely that a citadel would have stood within that compound to billet the Macedonian garrison which occupied it. [44]  It was normal for a Hellenistic city to have a fortified stronghold at or near the highest point of its walled area. [29]  Thus, whether a part of a larger enclave or independent of its surroundings, a citadel probably did stand at the northern tip of the City of David just south of the Temple Mount. Archaeologists have tried to use finds from excavations conducted in the area to pinpoint this citadel's precise location.\nYoram Tsafrir  has attempted to place the Acra underneath the southeastern corner of the later, Herodian Temple Mount enclosure. [64] [65] [72]  Tsafrir points to a straight vertical seam in the enclosure's eastern masonry wall as evidence of different periods of construction. North of the seam is an early section of the wall built of large  ashlar  blocks. These blocks have faces with drafted margins [26]  around a prominent  boss  and are laid in homogeneous header and  stretcher  courses, one above the other. [73]  This style of construction is Hellenistic and distinct from the Herodian construction apparent south of the seam. Although the exact dating of this construction in uncertain, Tsafrir believes it is a remnant of the Acra's foundations which were later incorporated into  Herod the Great 's extension of the Temple platform. [33] [64] [73]  As further proof, Tzafrir also points to a significant similarity between construction methods evident north of the seam, including the use of trapezoid-shaped stones, with the methods employed in the Seleucid city of  Perga  in  Asia Minor . 1 Macabees 1:30 attributes construction of the Acra to Apollonius, Antiochus\u00a0III's \"chief collector\" ( Hebrew :  \u05e9\u05e8-\u05d4\u05de\u05d9\u05e1\u05d9\u05dd ,  Sar Hamissim ), which appears to be an ancient mistranslation or his original title as chief ( Hebrew :  \u05e9\u05e8 ,  Sar ) of the  Mysians , a people of Asia Minor. [64] [73] \nSeveral cisterns under the Herodian Temple Mount extension have also been proposed as possible remnants of the Seleucid citadel. These include a 700,000- imperial-gallon  (3,200,000\u00a0l; 840,000\u00a0US\u00a0gal) cistern shaped like an E, the northern edge of which is adjacent to the proposed southern line of the Temple Mount precinct before its Herodian expansion. [74]  This has been identified as the \"be'er haqar\" or \"bor heqer\" mentioned in the  Mishnah , Erubin Tract 10.14, [75]  and commonly translated, perhaps incorrectly, as the \"cold well\". [76] \nMeir Ben-Dov  believed that the Acra stood just south of the  Huldah Gates  of the southern wall of the Herodian Temple Mount platform.  Benjamin Mazar 's 1968 and 1978 excavations of the  Ophel , the area adjoining the southern portion of the platform, have unearthed the foundations of a massive structure and a large  cistern , both possibly dating to the Hellenistic period. These have been tentatively identified as remnants of the Acra, with the structure, featuring rows of small interconnected rooms, believed to be the remains of a barracks. These had been demolished and built over during the Hasmonean period, matching the descriptions in Josephus. The Hasmonean constructions were, in turn, flattened to create a public square fronting the main gates to the Temple platform during the Herodian renovations. [77] [78] \nIn November 2015 the  Israel Antiquities Authority  (IAA) announced the possible discovery of the ancient site for the Acra. [79]  While excavating the  Givati parking lot  south-west of the Temple Mount and north-west of the City of David, the archaeologists  Doron Ben-Ami , Yana Tchekhanovets and Salome Cohen claimed that a complex of rooms and fortified walls they had unearthed was to be identified with the Acra mentioned in literary sources. This identification would, however, place it slightly south of previously suggested locations for the structure on the Ophel. Finds include fortification walls, a watchtower measuring 4 by 20 meters, and a  glacis . Bronze arrowheads, lead sling-stones and  ballista  stones were unearthed at the site, stamped with a trident, the emblem of Antiochus IV Epiphanes. These are indicative of the military nature of the site and the efforts to take it. The excavation also yielded coins from the reigns of Antiochus IV through Antiochus VII, as well as a multitude of stamped Rhodian  amphora  handles. [80] [81] \nThe Givati location has been doubted by  Leen Ritmeyer  due to its being too low on the hill to overlook the Temple Mount, as described in literary sources. [82] \nThe Acra was not the first Hellenistic stronghold in Jerusalem. Sources indicate that an earlier citadel, the Ptolemaic Baris, had also occupied a location overlooking the Temple's precincts. Although the exact location of the Baris is still debated, it is generally accepted to have stood north of the Temple Mount on the site later occupied by the  Antonia Fortress . [27]  The Baris fell to Antiochus\u00a0III at the turn of the 2nd century BCE and is absent from all accounts of the Maccabean Revolt. [44]  Despite the narratives which have the Acra constructed within a very short time-span, it was nevertheless formidable enough to weather long periods of siege. These factors, coupled with references in which the Baris was itself called an  acra , [11]  have led some to suggest that the Baris and the Acra were in fact the same structure. Although both 1 Maccabees and Josephus seem to describe the Acra as a new construction, this may not have been the case.  Antiquities of the Jews  12:253 may be translated to give the sense that the \"impious or wicked\" had \"remained\" rather than \"dwelt\" in the citadel, which could be taken to mean that the Acra had been standing before the revolt and that only the Macedonian garrison was new. [65] [83] \nKoen Decoster  proposes that Josephus wrote of \"a citadel in the lower part of the city\" to an audience that would have been familiar with the Jerusalem of the 1st century CE\u2014a city that did feature two citadels: the Antonia Fortress and the Herodian palace. As Josephus' Roman Jerusalem had already expanded to the higher western hill, \"a citadel in the lower city\" could have referred to anything located east of the Tyropoeon Valley, including the Antonia which stood north of the Temple and did indeed rise above and dominate it. In his view, this is the place Josephus must have had in mind when he wrote of the Acra. [8] \nOpponents of a northern location counter that this site is not supported by the historical sources, and that this would place the Acra away from Jerusalem's population center. Unlike its predecessor and successor citadels, it was not meant as a defence against external threat, but rather to oversee the inhabited Jewish parts of the city, a role incompatible with a proposed northern location. [44] \nSeveral researchers have attempted to place the Acra in the Upper City on Jerusalem's western hill, within the area currently occupied by the Old City's  Jewish Quarter . [44] [64] [84]  These propositions seek to locate the Acra within  Antiochia , the Hellenistic polis established in Jerusalem according to  2 Maccabees . This conjectural new city would have been  hippodamic  in plan and therefore would have required a flat expanse of land which only the western hill could have provided. [64]  Furthermore, the eastern edge of the hill is adjacent to the Temple Mount and higher in altitude\u2014two characteristics attributed to the Seleucid citadel. [84] \nOpponents of this proposed location point out that there is very little archaeological or historical evidence supporting the establishment of a Hellenistic polis within Jerusalem, let alone sited on the western hill which appears to have been only sparsely populated during the Hellenistic period. Excavations in today's Jewish Quarter display evidence of habitation from the  First Temple Period , as well as renewed Hasmonean and  Herodian  settlement, but scant evidence of Hellenistic occupation. [26] [64]  Research into the dispersal of stamped  Rhodian   amphorae  handles has revealed that over 95% of these handles found in Jerusalem were excavated from the City of David, indicating the city had not yet expanded to the western hill during Seleucid rule. [85]  Furthermore, the western hill is separated from the Temple Mount and the City of David by the steep  Tyropoeon Valley \u2014a distinct tactical disadvantage for any force that may have been required to intervene in events within the temple precincts or heavily populated eastern sectors of Jerusalem. [84] \nAdditional evidence for the existence of the Acra may come from the chance discovery, published by  Shimon Appelbaum \u00a0[ he ] , of a fragmentary Greek inscription in the Old City of Jerusalem. The inscription is a fragment from the top of a sandstone  stele  and contains what may be an oath taken by soldiers stationed in the Acra, although the reading of the name \"Acra\" in the text has been contested. [26] [86] \n\n"},
{"text": "\n\n\nThe  Benty Grange helmet  is an  Anglo-Saxon   boar-crested helmet  from the 7th century AD. It was excavated by  Thomas Bateman  in 1848 from a  tumulus  at the  Benty Grange  farm in  Monyash  in western  Derbyshire . The grave had probably been looted by the time of Bateman's excavation, but still contained other high-status objects suggestive of a richly furnished burial, such as the  fragmentary remains of a hanging bowl . The helmet is displayed at  Sheffield 's  Weston Park Museum , which purchased it from Bateman's estate in 1893.\nThe helmet was constructed by covering the outside of an iron framework with plates of horn and the inside with cloth or leather; the organic material has since decayed. It would have provided some protection against weapons, but was also ornate and may have been intended for ceremonial use. It was the first Anglo-Saxon helmet to be discovered, with five others found since:  Sutton Hoo (1939) ,  Coppergate (1982) ,  Wollaston (1997) ,  Shorwell (2004)  and  Staffordshire (2009) . The helmet features a unique combination of structural and technical attributes, but contemporaneous parallels exist for its individual characteristics. It is classified as one of the \"crested helmets\" used in Northern Europe from the 6th to 11th centuries AD.\nThe most striking feature of the helmet is the boar at its apex; this pagan symbol faces towards a  Christian cross  on the  nasal  in a display of  syncretism . This is representative of 7th-century England when Christian missionaries were slowly converting Anglo-Saxons away from traditional  Germanic paganism . The helmet seems to exhibit a stronger preference toward paganism, with a large boar and a small cross. The cross may have been added for talismanic effect, the help of any god being welcome on the battlefield. The boar atop the  crest  was likewise associated with protection and suggests a time when boar-crested helmets may have been common, as do the helmet from Wollaston and the  Guilden Morden boar . The contemporary epic  Beowulf  mentions such helmets five times and speaks of the strength of men \"when the hefted sword, its hammered edge and gleaming blade slathered in blood, razes the sturdy boar-ridge off a helmet\". [1] \nThe Benty Grange helmet was made by covering an iron frame with horn. [2]  It probably weighed about 1.4\u00a0kg (3.1\u00a0lb), the weight of the Weston Park Museum's 1986 replica. [3]  The framework, which now exists in sixteen corroded fragments, originally consisted of seven iron strips, each between 1 and 2 millimetres thick. [2]  A brow band, 65\u00a0cm (26\u00a0in) long and 2.5\u00a0cm (1.0\u00a0in) wide, encircled the head. [4]  Two strips of the same width ran from front to back, and from side to side. [4]  The 40\u00a0cm (16\u00a0in) long nose-to- nape  band extended 4.75\u00a0cm (1.87\u00a0in) in the front and 3.8\u00a0cm (1.5\u00a0in) in the back; the extension over the nose was straight, whereas the extension at the back was curved inwards, so as to fit the nape of the wearer. [4]  The lateral band ran from ear to ear; both ends are broken off slightly below the brow band, but it would have extended further as part of a cheek or ear protection. [4]  It was affixed to the outside of the  dexter  (wearer's right) side of the brow band, the inside of the  sinister  (wearer's left) side, and the outside of the nose-to-nape band. [4]  The four quadrants created by this configuration were each subdivided by a narrower subsidiary strip of iron, only one of which now survives. [5]  Each subsidiary strip was attached to the outside of the brow band 7\u00a0cm (2.8\u00a0in) from the centre of the lateral band. [4]  Here they were 22\u00a0mm (0.87\u00a0in) wide, and, while tapering towards a width of 15\u00a0mm (0.59\u00a0in), rose at a 70\u00b0 angle towards the lateral band, which they overlapped at a 50\u00b0 angle just beneath the crest. [4]  The inside of the helmet was most likely originally lined with leather or cloth, since decayed. [4] [3] \nEight plates of horn, probably softened and bent and suggested to be from  cattle , [note 1]  were cut to fit the eight spaces created by the iron frame. [10]  No horn now survives, but mineralized traces on the iron strips preserve the grain pattern. [4]  The plates were fitted over the iron, thereby hiding it, and abutted at the centre of each strip. [11]  The joins were hidden by further pieces of horn that were cut to the width of the iron strips and placed on top. [12]  The three layers\u2014iron at the bottom, followed by two layers of horn\u2014were held together by a succession of  rivets : [12]  iron rivets placed from inside the helmet, and rivets made of, or coated in, silver, with ornamental heads in the shape of a double-headed axe, placed from the outside, 4\u00a0cm (1.6\u00a0in) apart. [12]  Traces of horn on the rear extension of the nose-to-nape band, and on the rear brow band, suggest that the material was also used for a neck guard. [12]  These suggest that pieces of horn, extending 5\u00a0cm (2.0\u00a0in) from the centre of the brow band to the bottom of the rear nose-to-nape band, would have met each extension of the lateral band at a 5\u00b0 angle, reaching them 6.4\u00a0cm (2.5\u00a0in) from the centre of the brow band. [12] \nIn addition to the aesthetic elements incorporated into the basic construction of the helmet, two features provide added decoration: a cross on the  nasal  and a boar on the crest. [13]  The silver cross is 3.9\u00a0cm (1.5\u00a0in) long by 2\u00a0cm (0.8\u00a0in) wide, and consists of two parts. [14]  A silver strip was added underneath, elongating what was originally an equal-armed cross. [14]  It was placed atop a layer of horn and attached to the helmet with two rivets, one at the intersection of the two arms and one at the bottom. [15]  Around the cross in a zigzag pattern are twenty-nine silver studs, out of a suggested original forty, that were probably tapped into small holes drilled or bored into the horn. [16] \nThe most distinctive feature of the Benty Grange helmet is its boar, affixed to the apex of the helmet. [17]  The core of its body is made of two pieces of hollow D-sectioned bronze tubes, their flat sides approximately 2\u00a0mm (0.08\u00a0in) apart. [18]  The space between the two halves was filled in with a substance, likely horn or metal, which has now disintegrated; it perhaps projected upwards, forming the mane or spine of the boar, [18]  or, as has been interpreted on the replica, created a recess into which a mane of actual boar bristles could fit. [19]  On either side of the bronze core was affixed a plate of iron, forming the visible exterior of the boar. [20]  Four  pear -shaped plates of  gilded  silver\u2014cut down and filed from Roman silver, as evidenced by a classical leaf design on the reverse of the front left plate, and file marks on the  obverse \u2014acted as hips, through which passed two silver rivets, one atop the other, per end. [21]  These rivets held together the five layers of the boar, and were welded to the plates. [22]  Into the body of the boar were placed holes, probably punched, that held circular silver studs approximately 1.5\u00a0mm (0.06\u00a0in) in diameter. [23]  The studs, likely flush with the surface of the body, were filed down and gilded, and may have been intended to represent golden bristles. [23]  Eyes were formed with 5\u00a0mm (0.20\u00a0in) long pointed oval  garnets  set into gold sockets with  filigree  wire edging. [24]  The sockets were 8\u00a0mm (0.31\u00a0in) long by 3.5\u00a0mm (0.14\u00a0in) wide, and had 8\u00a0mm (0.31\u00a0in) long shanks, filled with  beeswax , sunk into the head. [24]  Individual pieces of gilded bronze seem to have formed the tail, tusks, muzzle, jawline, and ears of the boar, but few traces of them now remain. [25]  Two sets of iron legs\u2014probably solid originally, but rendered hollow by corrosion\u2014attached the body to an elliptical bronze plate; both sets depict front legs, bent forwards without account for the anatomical differences between a boar's fore and hind limbs. [25]  The elliptical plate is 9\u00a0cm (3.5\u00a0in) long with a maximum width of 1.9\u00a0cm (0.75\u00a0in), and matches the curvature of the helmet. [26]  Four holes indicate attachment points for the legs and another three connected the plate to the frame of the helmet, in addition to a large rivet hole slightly behind the centre. [26]  The plate was probably affixed directly to the frame, the legs passing through holes in the horn. [27] [28] \nThe Benty Grange helmet would have both offered some protection if worn in battle, and indicated its wearer's status. [3]  As the Weston Park replica shows, it would have originally been an impressive object, [29]  and may have been intended for ceremonial use. [3]  Experiments using a mockup of the replica also showed that the helmet would have resisted blows with an  axe , which damaged the horn without entirely breaking it. [3]  Arrows and spears pierced the horn, but they also pierced modern fibreglass and safety helmets. [3] \nHelmets were rare in Anglo-Saxon England, and the Benty Grange helmet, both by its richness and its scarcity, signified the high status of its owner. [3] [29] [30]  Such protection certainly seems to have been among the armour of the affluent. [31] [32]  In the contemporary epic  Beowulf , a poem about kings and nobles, they are relatively common, [31] [32]  while the helmeted  Vendel  and  Valsg\u00e4rde  graves from the same period in Sweden, thought to be the burials of wealthy non-royals, suggest that helmets were not solely for the use of the \u00e9lite. [33]  Yet thousands of furnished Anglo-Saxon graves have been excavated since the start of the 19th century and helmets remain rare; [34] [35] [36]  this may partly reflect poor rates of artefact survival or even recognition, but their extreme scarcity indicates that they were never deposited in great numbers. [36] \nThe helmet was discovered in a  barrow  on the  Benty Grange  farm in Derbyshire, [37]  in what is now the  Peak District  National Park. [28]   Thomas Bateman , an archaeologist and antiquarian who led the excavation, [note 2]  described Benty Grange as \"a high and bleak situation\"; [37]  its barrow, which still survives, is prominently located by a major Roman road, [40]  now the  A515 , possibly to display the burial to passing travellers. [41]  It may have also been designed to share the skyline with two other nearby monuments,  Arbor Low   stone circle  and  Gib Hill  barrow. [41] \nThe seventh-century Peak District was a small buffer state between  Mercia  and  Northumbria , occupied, according to the  Tribal Hidage , by the Anglo-Saxon  Pecs\u00e6te . [42] [43]  The area came under the fold of the  Mercian  kingdom around the eighth century; [43]  the Benty Grange and other rich barrows suggest that the Pecs\u00e6te may have had their own dynasty beforehand, but there is no written evidence for this. [42] \nBateman excavated the barrow on 3 May 1848. [37]  Although he did not mention it in his account, he was likely not the first person to dig up the grave. [44]  The fact that the objects were found in two clusters separated by 6\u00a0ft (1.8\u00a0m), and that other objects that normally accompany a helmet were absent, such as a sword and shield, suggests that the grave had previously been looted. [44]  Being so large it may alternatively or additionally have contained two burials, only one of which was discovered by Bateman. [45] \nThe barrow comprises a circular central mound approximately 15\u00a0m (50\u00a0ft) in diameter and 0.6\u00a0m (2\u00a0ft) high, an encircling fosse about 1\u00a0m (3.3\u00a0ft) wide and 0.3\u00a0m (1\u00a0ft) deep, and outer penannular earthworks around 3\u00a0m (10\u00a0ft) wide and 0.2\u00a0m (0.66\u00a0ft) high. [45]  The entire structure measures approximately 23 by 22\u00a0m (75 by 72\u00a0ft). [45]  Bateman suggested a body once lay at its centre, flat against the original surface of the soil; [37] [46]  what he described as the one remnant, strands of hair, is now thought to be from a cloak of fur, cowhide or something similar. [47]  The recovered objects were found in two clusters. [44] [48] [49]  One cluster was found in the area of the supposed hair, the other about 6\u00a0ft (1.8\u00a0m) to the west. [48] [49]  In the former area Bateman described \"a curious assemblage of ornaments\", which were difficult to remove successfully from the hardened earth. [37] [48]  This included a cup identified as leather but probably of wood, [50] [51]  approximately 3\u00a0in (7.6\u00a0cm) in diameter at the mouth. [37] [52]  Its rim was edged with silver, [37]  while its surface was \"decorated by four wheel-shaped ornaments and two crosses of thin silver, affixed by pins of the same metal, clenched inside\". [53]  Also found were  the remnants  of three  hanging bowl  escutcheons, [52] [53] [54]  as well as \"a knot of very fine wire\", and some \"thin bone variously ornamented with lozenges &c.\" [53]  attached to silk, but that soon decayed when exposed to air. [55] \nApproximately 6\u00a0ft (1.8\u00a0m) to the west of the other objects was found a jumbled mass of ironwork. [56] [57] [58]  Separated, this mass included a collection of chainwork, a six-pronged piece of iron resembling a  hayfork , and the helmet. [56] [57] [58]  As Bateman described it:\nBateman closed his 1849 account of the excavation by noting the \"particularly corrosive nature of the soil\", [59]  which by 1861 he said \"has generally been the case in tumuli in Derbyshire\". [60]  He suggested that this was the result of \"a mixing or tempering with some corrosive liquid; the result of which is the presence of thin ochrey veins in the earth, and the decomposition of nearly the whole of the human remains.\" [60]  Bateman's friend  Llewellynn Jewitt , an artist and antiquarian who frequently accompanied Bateman on excavations, [61]  painted four watercolours of the finds, parts of which were included in Bateman's 1849 account. [62] [note 3]  This was more than Jewitt produced for any other of their excavations, a mark of the importance that they assigned to the Benty Grange barrow. [62] \nThe helmet entered the extensive collection of Bateman, where it attracted interest. [66]  On 27 October 1848 he related his discoveries, including the helmet, to the  British Arch\u00e6ological Association , [67] [68] [69]  and in 1855 it was catalogued along with other objects from the Benty Grange barrow. [70]  In 1861 Bateman died at 39, [39]  and in 1876 his son, Thomas W. Bateman, loaned the objects to Sheffield. [71]  They were displayed at the  Weston Park Museum  through 1893, at which time the museum purchased objects, including the helmet, from the family; other pieces were dispersed elsewhere. [72]  As of 2021, the helmet remains in the collection of the museum. [73]  From 8 November 1991 to 8 March 1992 it joined the  Coppergate helmet  at the  British Museum  for  The Making of England: Anglo-Saxon Art and Culture, AD 600\u2013900 . [74] [75] \nThe Benty Grange barrow was designated a  scheduled monument  on 23 October 1970. [45]  The list entry notes that \"[a]lthough the centre of Benty Grange [barrow] has been partially disturbed by excavation, the monument is otherwise undisturbed and retains significant archaeological remains.\" [45]  It goes on to note that further excavation would yield new information. [45]  The nearby farm was renovated between 2012 and 2014; [76] [77]  as of 2021 it is rented out as a holiday cottage. [78] \nIn 1948, the helmet was brought to the British Museum to undergo cleaning and study. [79]  Permission to carry out the work had been requested the previous year, [80]  when  Rupert Bruce-Mitford , recently returned from  World War II  service in the  Royal Signals  to an assistant keepership at the museum, [81]  spent time in Sheffield examining the Benty Grange  grave goods . [44]  A 1940 letter from  T. D. Kendrick  to Bruce-Mitford's army camp had assigned him his position, and responsibility for the  Sutton Hoo  discoveries\u2014\"Brace yourself for the task\", the letter concluded. [82]  Upon his return, he therefore took to studying the comparison material; his work in 1947 included the excavation of the Valsg\u00e4rde 11 boat-grave in Sweden alongside  Sune Lindqvist , [83] [84]  and the trip to Sheffield, intended to shed light on the  Sutton Hoo helmet  through comparison with the only other Anglo-Saxon helmet then known. [44]  Permission was obtained from the curator and trustees of the Weston Park Museum for the proposed work, and, by February 1948\u2014when, shortly before the centennial of its excavation, Bruce-Mitford exhibited it to the  Society of Antiquaries of London \u2014the Benty Grange helmet was brought to London. [85] [79] \nWork at the British Museum was overseen by keeper of the research laboratory  Harold Plenderleith , who in some cases, particularly with the boar, did the work himself; additional input was provided by Bruce-Mitford, the technical attach\u00e9 and authority on ancient metalwork  Herbert Maryon , and the archaeologist and art historian  Fran\u00e7oise Henry . [86]  In the hundred years following its exposure to the air the helmet had continued to corrode, and certain parts had become indiscernible. [73]  The boar was unrecognizable, and the silver rivets and cross were almost completely obscured. [87]  A strong needle was used to pick off the encrustation, revealing the underlying features. [88]  During this process, the boar, hitherto thought solid, snapped in two. [88]  Bruce-Mitford termed this occurrence \"fortunate\", for it revealed the boar's inner structure. [88]   Frederic Charles Fraser  examined the remnants of horn at the  Natural History Museum , and conducted experiments softening and shaping modern horn. [6] \nThe Benty Grange helmet is dated to the first half of the 7th century AD, on the basis of its technical construction and decorative style. [89]  It is one of six  Anglo-Saxon  helmets, joined by the subsequent discoveries from  Sutton Hoo ,  York ,  Wollaston ,  Shorwell , and  Staffordshire . [35]  These are all, other than the Frankish Shorwell helmet, [90]  examples of the \"crested helmets\" known in  Northern Europe  in the 6th through 11th centuries AD. [91] [92]  Such helmets are characterized by prominent crests and rounded caps, traits shared by the Benty Grange example, [93]  and other than a  Viking Age  fragment found in  Kiev , uniformly originate from England or Scandinavia; contemporary continental helmets were primarily  spangenhelm  or  lamellenhelm . [94] [95] \nThe ultimate form of the helmet is unparalleled among surviving Anglo-Saxon and crested helmets, although individual characteristics are shared. [96]  While other Anglo-Saxon helmets were typically formed with wide perpendicular bands and four infill plates, [97] [98] [99] [note 4]  their Swedish counterparts from Vendel and Valsg\u00e4rde display similar use of thin iron frameworks. [96]  The complicated construction of the Benty Grange boar, which combines garnet, filigree, gold, silver, iron, and bronze, is unique across ornamental Anglo-Saxon objects, [24]  but the general boar-crest is paralleled by the Wollaston and  Guilden Morden  boars. [103] [104]  One other helmet exhibits the use of horn, but it is the spangenhelm-type helmet of a high-status child, discovered in  Cologne . [4] [105] \nThe helmet was made during the nascent days of  Christianity in Anglo-Saxon England , and exhibits both  Christian  and  pagan  motifs. [106]  The boar invoked a pagan tradition [107]  and the cross a Christian belief.  Roman Britain  had been officially converted to Christianity in the fourth century, although Celtic paganism remained strong. In the fifth century Ireland was converted by British missionaries and in 563 Irish missionaries based in the monastery of  Iona  off the western coast of Scotland embarked on the conversion of the  Picts . Christianity almost disappeared in southern Britain after its conquest by the pagan Anglo-Saxons in the fifth and sixth centuries, apart from the surviving Celtic areas of southwest England and Wales. In 597 Pope  Gregory the Great  sent the  Gregorian mission  to Kent to embark on the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons. It rapidly converted kingdoms as far north as Northumbria, but initial success was often followed by a period of apostasy and in several cases the final conversion was carried out by Irish missionaries from Iona. It is not known whether the Pecs\u00e6te were converted by adherents of the Roman or Irish Celtic tradition. [108] [109] \nThe Benty Grange helmet was made during this time of change, as evidenced by its  syncretic  display. [106]  It emphasises the pagan element, a large boar dominating a small cross. [110]  The cross may not necessarily be an indication of Christian belief; it may have instead been chosen for its  amuletic  effect. [96] [111]  Whatever the politics behind religious conversion, the battlefield was not a place to discriminate against gods. [112] \n"},

[2]  Breaking from Shaiva tradition of previous kings, Angkor Wat was dedicated to Vishnu for the  Khmer Empire .\nIt was built by the Khmer King  Suryavarman II [3]  in the early 12th century in  Ya\u015bodharapura  ( Khmer :  \u1799\u179f\u17c4\u1792\u179a\u1794\u17bb\u179a\u17c8 , present-day  Angkor ), the capital of the  Khmer Empire , as his state temple and eventual mausoleum. Angkor Wat combines two basic plans of Khmer temple architecture: the  temple-mountain  and the later  galleried temple . It is designed to represent  Mount Meru , home of the  devas  in  Hindu mythology : within a  moat  more than 5 kilometres (3\u00a0mi) long [4]  and an outer wall 3.6 kilometres (2.2\u00a0mi) long are three rectangular galleries, each raised above the next. At the centre of the temple stands a  quincunx  of towers. Unlike most Angkorian temples, Angkor Wat is oriented to the west; scholars are divided as to the significance of this. The temple is admired for the grandeur and harmony of the architecture, its extensive  bas-reliefs , and for the numerous  devatas  adorning its walls.\nAs the best-preserved temple at the site, Angkor Wat is the only one to have remained a significant religious centre since its foundation. The temple is at the top of the high classical style of Khmer architecture. It is one of the most important pilgrimage sites for Buddhists in Cambodia and around the world, [5]  having played a major role in  converting Cambodia into a Buddhist nation . [6]  It has become a symbol of Cambodia, [7]  appearing on  its national flag , and is the country's main tourist attraction. [8] \nThe modern name Angkor Wat, alternatively Nokor Wat, [9]  means \"Temple City\" or \"City of Temples\" in  Khmer .  Angkor  ( \u17a2\u1784\u17d2\u1782\u179a   \u00e2ngk\u00f4r ) meaning \"city\" or \"capital city\", is a vernacular form of the word  nokor  ( \u1793\u1782\u179a   n\u00f4k\u00f4r ), which comes from the  Sanskrit / Pali  word  nagara  ( Devan\u0101gar\u012b : \u0928\u0917\u0930). [10]   Wat  ( \u179c\u178f\u17d2\u178f   v\u00f4tt ) is the word for \"temple grounds\", also derived from Sanskrit/Pali  v\u0101\u1e6da  ( Devan\u0101gar\u012b : \u0935\u093e\u091f), meaning \"enclosure\". [11] \nThe original name of the temple was Vrah Vi\u1e63\u1e47uloka or Parama Vi\u1e63\u1e47uloka meaning \"the sacred dwelling of  Vishnu .\" [12] [6] \nAngkor Wat lies  .mw-parser-output .frac{white-space:nowrap}.mw-parser-output .frac .num,.mw-parser-output .frac .den{font-size:80%;line-height:0;vertical-align:super}.mw-parser-output .frac .den{vertical-align:sub}.mw-parser-output .sr-only{border:0;clip:rect(0,0,0,0);height:1px;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;padding:0;position:absolute;width:1px} 5.5 kilometres ( 3 + 1 \u2044 2 \u00a0mi) north of the modern town of  Siem Reap , and a short distance south and slightly east of the previous capital, which was centred at  Baphuon . In an area of Cambodia where there is an essential group of ancient structures, it is the southernmost of Angkor's main sites. [ citation needed ] \nAccording to a myth, the construction of Angkor Wat was ordered by  Indra  to serve as a palace for his son Precha Ket Mealea. [13]  According to the 13th-century Chinese traveller  Zhou Daguan , some believed that the temple was constructed in a single night by a divine architect. [14] \nThe  brahmin  by the name of Div\u0101karapa\u1e47\u1e0dita was responsible for urging King  Suryavarman II  to construct Angkor Wat. [15]   The initial design and construction of the temple took place in the first half of the 12th century, during the reign of  Suryavarman II  (ruled 1113 \u2013  c. \u20091150 ). All of the original religious motifs derived from  Hinduism . [16]  Breaking from the  Shaiva  tradition of previous kings, Angkor Wat was instead dedicated to  Vishnu . It was built as the king's state temple and capital city. As neither the foundation  stela  nor any contemporary inscriptions referring to the temple have been found, its original name is unknown, but it may have been known as \"Varah Vishnu- lok \" after the presiding deity. Work seems to have ended shortly after the king's death, leaving some of the  bas-relief  decoration unfinished. [17]  The term  Vrah Vi\u1e63\u1e47uloka  or  Parama Vi\u1e63\u1e47uloka  literally means \"The king who has gone to the supreme world of Vishnu\", which refer to Suryavarman II posthumously and intend to venerate his glory and memory. [12] \nIn 1177, approximately 27 years after the death of  Suryavarman II , Angkor was sacked by the  Chams , the traditional enemies of the Khmer. [18]  Thereafter the empire was restored by a new king,  Jayavarman VII , who established a new capital and state temple ( Angkor Thom  and the  Bayon , respectively), a few kilometers north, dedicated to Buddhism, because the king believed that the Hindu gods had failed him. Angkor Wat was therefore also gradually converted into a Buddhist site, and many Hindu sculptures were replaced by Buddhist art. [16] \nTowards the end of the 12th century, Angkor Wat gradually transformed from a Hindu centre of worship to  Buddhism , which continues to the present day. [19]  Angkor Wat is unusual among the Angkor temples in that although it was largely neglected after the 16th century, it was never completely abandoned. [20]  Fourteen inscriptions dated from the 17th century, discovered in the Angkor area, testify to  Japanese  Buddhist pilgrims that had established small settlements alongside Khmer locals. [21]  At that time, the temple was thought by the Japanese visitors to be the famed  Jetavana  garden of the  Buddha , which was originally located in the kingdom of  Magadha , India. [22]  The best-known inscription tells of  Ukondayu Kazufusa , who celebrated the  Khmer New Year  at Angkor Wat in 1632. [23] \nOne of the first Western visitors to the temple was  Ant\u00f3nio da Madalena , a  Portuguese  friar who visited in 1586 and said that it \"is of such extraordinary construction that it is not possible to describe it with a pen, particularly since it is like no other building in the world. It has towers and decoration and all the refinements which the human genius can conceive of.\" [24] \nIn 1622,  The Poem of Angkor Wat  composed in Khmer verse describes the beauty of Angkor Wat and creates a legend around the construction of the complex, supposedly a divine castle built for legendary Khmer king Preah Ket Mealea by Hindu god Preah Pisnukar (or Bra\u1e25 Bis\u1e47uk\u0101r,  Vishvakarman ), as Suryavarman II had already vanished from people's minds. [25] \n\nIn 1860, with the help of French missionary Father Charles-\u00c9mile Bouillevaux, the temple was effectively rediscovered by the French naturalist and explorer  Henri Mouhot , who popularised the site in the West through the publication of travel notes, in which he wrote: .mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}In 1861 German anthropologist  Adolf Bastian  undertook a four-year trip to  Southeast Asia  and his account of this trip,  The People of East Asia  ran to six volumes. When Bastian finally published the studies and observations during his  Journey through Cambodia to Cochinchina  in Germany in 1868 - told in detail but uninspiredly, above all without a single one of his drawings of the Angkorian sites - this work hardly made an impression, while everyone was talking about  Henri Mouhot 's posthumous work with vivid descriptions of  Angkor ,  Travels in the Central Parts of Indo-China, Siam, Cambodia and Laos , published in 1864 through the  Royal Geographical Society . [27] \nThere were no ordinary dwellings or houses or other signs of settlement, including cooking utensils, weapons, or items of clothing usually found at ancient sites. Instead, there is only evidence of the monuments themselves. [28] \nThe artistic legacy of Angkor Wat and other Khmer monuments in the  Angkor  region led directly to France adopting Cambodia as a  protectorate  on 11 August 1863 and invading  Siam  to take control of the ruins. This quickly led to Cambodia reclaiming lands in the northwestern corner of the country such as the areas of Siem Reap,  Battambang  and  Sisophon  which were under Siamese rule from 1795 to 1907. [29] [30] \nAngkor Wat's aesthetics were on display in the plaster cast museum of  Louis Delaporte  called  mus\u00e9e Indo-chinois  which existed in the Parisian  Trocadero Palace  from c.1880 to the mid-1920s. [31] \nThe 20th century saw a considerable restoration of Angkor Wat. [32]  Gradually teams of laborers and archeologists pushed back the jungle and exposed the expanses of stone, permitting the sun to once again illuminate the dark corners of the temple. Angkor Wat caught the attention and imagination of a wider audience in Europe when the pavilion of  French protectorate of Cambodia , as part of  French Indochina , recreated the life-size replica of Angkor Wat during  Paris Colonial Exposition  in 1931. [33] \nCambodia gained independence from France on 9 November 1953 and has controlled Angkor Wat since that time. It is safe to say that from the colonial period onwards until the site's nomination as  UNESCO World Heritage  in 1992, this specific temple of Angkor Wat was instrumental in the formation of the modern and gradually globalised concept of built cultural heritage. [34] \nRestoration work was interrupted by the  Cambodian Civil War  and  Khmer Rouge  control of the country during the 1970s and 1980s, but relatively little damage was done during this period. Camping Khmer Rouge forces used whatever wood remained in the building structures for firewood, and a shoot-out between Khmer Rouge and Vietnamese forces put a few bullet holes in a bas relief. Far more damage was done after the wars, by  art thieves  working out of Thailand, which, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, claimed almost every head that could be lopped off the structures, including reconstructions. [35] \nThe temple is a powerful symbol of Cambodia, and is a source of great national pride that has factored into Cambodia's diplomatic relations with France, the United States, and its neighbour Thailand. A depiction of Angkor Wat has been a part of  Cambodian national flags  since the introduction of the first version circa 1863. [36]  From a larger historical and even transcultural perspective, however, the temple of Angkor Wat did not become a symbol of national pride  sui generis  but had been inscribed into a larger politico-cultural process of French-colonial heritage production in which the original temple site was presented in French colonial and universal exhibitions in Paris and Marseille between 1889 and 1937. [37] \nIn December 2015, it was announced that a research team from  University of Sydney  had found a previously unseen ensemble of buried towers built and demolished during the construction of Angkor Wat, as well as a massive structure of unknown purpose on its south side and wooden fortifications. The findings also include evidence of low-density residential occupation in the region, with a road grid, ponds, and mounds. These indicate that the temple precinct, bounded by moat and wall, may not have been used exclusively by the priestly elite, as was previously thought. The team used  LiDAR ,  ground-penetrating radar  and targeted excavation to map Angkor Wat. [38] \nAngkor Wat is a unique combination of the  temple mountain  (the standard design for the empire's state temples) and the later plan of concentric  galleries , most of which were derived from religious beliefs of  Hinduism  originally. [16]  The construction of Angkor Wat also suggests that there was a celestial significance with certain features of the temple. This is observed in the temple's east\u2013west orientation, and lines of sight from terraces within the temple that show specific towers to be at the precise location of the sunrise on a solstice. [39]  The temple is a representation of  Mount Meru , the home of the gods according to  Hindu  mythology: the central  quincunx  of towers symbolises the five peaks of the mountain, and the walls and moat symbolize the surrounding mountain ranges and ocean. [40]  Access to the upper areas of the temple was progressively more exclusive, with the laity being admitted only to the lowest level. [41] \nThe Angkor Wat temple's main tower aligns to the morning sun of the  spring equinox . [42] [43]  Unlike most Khmer temples, Angkor Wat is oriented to the west rather than the east. This has led many (including  Maurice Glaize  and  George Coed\u00e8s ) to conclude that Suryavarman intended it to serve as his funerary temple. [44] [45]  Further evidence for this view is provided by the  bas-reliefs , which proceed in a counter-clockwise direction\u2014 prasavya  in  Hindu  terminology\u2014as this is the reverse of the normal order. Rituals take place in reverse order during Brahminic funeral services. [32] \nArchaeologist  Charles Higham  also describes a container which may have been a funerary jar which was recovered from the central tower. [46]  It has been nominated by some as the greatest expenditure of energy on the disposal of a corpse. [47]  Freeman and Jacques, however, note that several other temples of  Angkor  depart from the typical eastern orientation, and suggest that Angkor Wat's alignment was due to its dedication to  Vishnu , who was associated with the west. [40] \nDrawing on the temple's alignment and dimensions, and on the content and arrangement of the bas-reliefs, researcher Eleanor Mannikka argues that the structure represents a claimed new era of peace under King  Suryavarman II : \"as the measurements of solar and lunar time cycles were built into the sacred space of Angkor Wat, this divine mandate to rule was anchored to consecrated chambers and corridors meant to perpetuate the king's power and to honour and placate the deities manifest in the heavens above.\" [48] [49]  Mannikka's suggestions have been received with a mixture of interest and scepticism in academic circles. [46]  She distances herself from the speculations of others, such as  Graham Hancock , that Angkor Wat is part of a representation of the constellation  Draco . [50] \nThe oldest surviving plan of Angkor Wat dates to 1715 and is credited to Fujiwara Tadayoshi. The plan is stored in the Suifu Meitoku-kai Shokokan Museum in  Mito ,  Japan . [51] \nAngkor Wat is the prime example of the classical style of  Khmer architecture \u2014the Angkor Wat style\u2014to which it has given its name. By the 12th century Khmer architects had become skilled and confident in the use of  sandstone  (rather than brick or  laterite ) as the main building material. Most of the visible areas are of sandstone blocks, while laterite was used for the outer wall and for hidden structural parts. The binding agent used to join the blocks is yet to be identified, although natural  resins  or  slaked lime  has been suggested. [52] \nThe temple has drawn praise above all for the harmony of its design. According to Maurice Glaize, a mid-20th-century conservator of Angkor, the temple \"attains a classic perfection by the restrained monumentality of its finely balanced elements and the precise arrangement of its proportions. It is a work of power, unity, and style.\" [53] \nArchitecturally, the elements characteristic of the style include: the  ogival , redented towers shaped like  lotus  buds; half- galleries  to broaden passageways; axial galleries connecting enclosures; and the cruciform terraces which appear along the main axis of the temple. Typical decorative elements are  devatas (or apsaras) ,  bas-reliefs , and on  pediments  extensive garlands and narrative scenes. The statuary of Angkor Wat is considered conservative, being more static and less graceful than earlier work. [54]  Other elements of the design have been destroyed by looting and the passage of time, including  gilded   stucco  on the towers, gilding on some figures on the bas-reliefs, and wooden ceiling panels and doors. [55] \nThe outer wall, 1,024\u00a0m (3,360\u00a0ft) by 802\u00a0m (2,631\u00a0ft) and 4.5\u00a0m (15\u00a0ft) high, is surrounded by a 30\u00a0m (98\u00a0ft) apron of open ground and a moat 190\u00a0m (620\u00a0ft) wide and over 5 kilometres (3\u00a0mi) in perimeter. [4]  The moat extends 1.5 kilometres from east to west and 1.3 kilometres from north to south. [57]  Access to the temple is by an earth bank to the east and a sandstone causeway to the west; the latter, the main entrance, is a later addition, possibly replacing a wooden bridge. [58]  There are  gopuras  at each of the  cardinal points ; the western is by far the largest and has three ruined towers. Glaize notes that this gopura both hides and echoes the form of the temple proper. [59] \nUnder the southern tower is a statue known as  Ta Reach , originally an eight-armed statue of Vishnu may have occupied the temple's central shrine. [58]  Galleries run between the towers and as far as two further entrances on either side of the gopura often referred to as \"elephant gates\", as they are large enough to admit those animals. These galleries have square pillars on the outer (west) side and a closed wall on the inner (east) side. The ceiling between the pillars is decorated with  lotus  rosettes; the west face of the wall with dancing figures; and the east face of the wall with balustered windows, dancing male figures on prancing animals, and  devatas , including (south of the entrance) the only one in the temple to be showing her teeth.\nThe outer wall encloses a space of 820,000 square metres (203 acres), which besides the temple proper was originally occupied by the city and, to the north of the temple, the royal palace. Like all secular buildings of Angkor, these were built of perishable materials rather than of stone, so nothing remains of them except the outlines of some of the streets. [60]  Most of the area is now covered by forest. A 350\u00a0m (1,150\u00a0ft) causeway connects the western gopura to the temple proper, with  naga  balustrades and six sets of steps leading down to the city on either side. Each side also features a  library  with entrances at each cardinal point, in front of the third set of stairs from the entrance, and a pond between the library and the temple itself. The ponds are later additions to the design, as is the cruciform terrace guarded by lions connecting the causeway to the central structure. [60] \nThe temple stands on a terrace raised higher than the city. It is made of three rectangular  galleries  rising to a central tower, each level higher than the last. The two inner galleries each have four large towers at their  ordinal  corners (that is, NW, NE, SE and SW) surrounding a higher fifth tower. This pattern is sometimes called a quincunx and represents the mountains of  Meru . Because the temple faces west, the features are all set back towards the east, leaving more space to be filled in each enclosure and gallery on the west side; for the same reason the west-facing steps are shallower than those on the other sides.\nMannikka interprets the galleries as being dedicated to the king,  Brahma , the moon, and  Vishnu . [17]  Each gallery has a  gopura  at each of the points. The outer gallery measures 187\u00a0m (614\u00a0ft) by 215\u00a0m (705\u00a0ft), with pavilions rather than towers at the corners. The gallery is open to the outside of the temple, with columned half-galleries extending and buttressing the structure. Connecting the outer gallery to the second enclosure on the west side is a cruciform cloister called  Preah Poan  (meaning \"The Thousand Buddhas\" Gallery). [6]   Buddha  images were left in the cloister by pilgrims over the centuries, although most have now been removed. This area has many inscriptions relating the good deeds of pilgrims, most written in  Khmer  but others in  Burmese  and Japanese. The four small courtyards marked out by the cloister may originally have been filled with water. [61]  North and south of the cloister are  libraries .\nBeyond, the second and inner galleries are connected to each other and to two flanking libraries by another cruciform terrace, again a later addition. From the second level upwards,  devatas  abound on the walls, singly or in groups of up to four. The second-level enclosure is 100\u00a0m (330\u00a0ft) by 115\u00a0m (377\u00a0ft), and may originally have been flooded to represent the  ocean  around  Mount Meru . [62]  Three sets of steps on each side lead up to the corner towers and gopuras of the inner gallery. The very steep stairways represent the difficulty of ascending to the kingdom of the gods. [63]  This inner gallery, called the  Bakan , is a 60\u00a0m (200\u00a0ft) square with axial galleries connecting each gopura with the central shrine, and subsidiary shrines located below the corner towers.\nThe roofings of the galleries are decorated with the motif of the body of a snake ending in the heads of lions or  garudas . Carved  lintels and pediments  decorate the entrances to the galleries and to the shrines. The tower above the central shrine rises 43\u00a0m (141\u00a0ft) to a height of 65\u00a0m (213\u00a0ft) above the ground; unlike those of previous temple mountains, the central tower is raised above the surrounding four. [64]  The shrine itself, originally occupied by a statue of Vishnu and open on each side, was walled in when the temple was converted to  Theravada Buddhism , the new walls featuring standing Buddhas. In 1934, the conservator George Trouv\u00e9 excavated the pit beneath the central shrine: filled with sand and water it had already been robbed of its treasure, but he did find a sacred foundation deposit of  gold leaf  two metres above ground level. [65] \nIntegrated with the architecture of the building, and one of the causes for its fame is Angkor Wat's extensive decoration, which predominantly takes the form of  bas-relief  friezes. The inner walls of the outer gallery bear a series of large-scale scenes mainly depicting episodes from the  Hindu  epics the  Ramayana  and the  Mahabharata . Higham has called these \"the greatest known linear arrangement of stone carving\". [66]  From the north-west corner anti-clockwise, the western gallery shows the Battle of Lanka (from the Ramayana, in which  Rama  defeats  Ravana ) and the  Battle of Kurukshetra  (from the Mahabharata, showing the mutual annihilation of the  Kaurava  and  Pandava  clans). On the southern gallery follow the only historical scene, a procession of  Suryavarman II , then the 32  hells  and 37  heavens  of Hinduism. [67] \nOn the eastern gallery is one of the most celebrated scenes, the  Churning of the Sea of Milk , showing 92 [68]   asuras  and 88  devas  using the serpent  Vasuki  to churn the sea under Vishnu's direction (Mannikka counts only 91 asuras, and explains the asymmetrical numbers as representing the number of days from the  winter solstice  to the  spring equinox , and from the equinox to the summer  solstice ). [69]  It is followed by Vishnu defeating  asuras  (a 16th-century addition). The northern gallery shows Krishna's victory over  Bana  (where according to Glaize, \"The workmanship is at its worst\"). [70] \nAngkor Wat is decorated with depictions of  apsaras  and  devata ; there are more than 1,796 depictions of devata in the present research inventory. [71]  Angkor Wat architects employed small apsara images (30\u201340\u00a0cm or 12\u201316\u00a0in) as decorative motifs on pillars and walls. They incorporated larger devata images (all full-body portraits measuring approximately 95\u2013110\u00a0cm or 37\u201343\u00a0in) more prominently at every level of the temple from the entry pavilion to the tops of the high towers. In 1927, Sappho Marchal published a study cataloging the remarkable diversity of their hair, headdresses, garments, stance, jewellery and decorative flowers, which Marchal concluded were based on actual practices of the Angkor period. [72] \nThe monument was made out of five to ten million sandstone blocks with a maximum weight of 1.5 tons each. [73]  The entire city of  Angkor  used far greater amounts of stone than all the Egyptian pyramids combined and occupied an area significantly greater than modern-day  Paris . Moreover, unlike the Egyptian pyramids, which use limestone quarried  0.5\u00a0km ( 1 \u2044 4 \u00a0mi) away, the entire city of Angkor was built with sandstone quarried 40\u00a0km (25\u00a0mi) (or more) away. [74]  This sandstone had to be transported from Mount Kulen, a quarry approximately 40 kilometres (25\u00a0mi) northeast. [75] \nThe route has been suggested to span 35 kilometres (22\u00a0mi) along a canal towards  Tonl\u00e9 Sap  lake, another 35 kilometres (22\u00a0mi) crossing the lake, and finally 15 kilometres (9\u00a0mi) against the current along  Siem Reap River , making a total journey of 90 kilometres (55\u00a0mi). However, Etsuo Uchida and Ichita Shimoda of  Waseda University  in  Tokyo , Japan have discovered in 2011 a shorter 35-kilometre (22\u00a0mi) canal connecting Mount Kulen and Angkor Wat using satellite imagery. The two believe that the Khmer used this route instead. [75] \nVirtually all of its surfaces, columns, lintels, and even roofs are carved. There are kilometres of reliefs illustrating scenes from  Indian literature  including unicorns, griffins, winged dragons pulling chariots as well as warriors following an elephant-mounted leader and celestial dancing girls with elaborate hairstyles. The gallery wall alone is decorated with almost 1,000\u00a0m 2  (11,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) of bas reliefs. Holes on some of the Angkor walls indicate that they may have been decorated with bronze sheets. These were highly prized in ancient times and were a prime target for robbers. [76] \nWhile excavating Khajuraho, Alex Evans, a stonemason and sculptor, recreated a stone sculpture under 1.2 metres (4\u00a0ft), this took about 60 days to carve. [76]  Roger Hopkins and Mark Lehner also conducted experiments to quarry limestone which took 12 quarrymen 22 days to quarry about 400 tons of stone. [77]  The labour force to quarry, transport, carve and install so much sandstone must have run into the thousands including many highly skilled artisans. The skills required to carve these sculptures were developed hundreds of years earlier, as demonstrated by some artefacts that have been dated to the seventh century, before the Khmer came to power. [28] [47] \nAs with most other ancient temples in Cambodia, Angkor Wat has faced extensive damage and deterioration by a combination of plant overgrowth, fungi, ground movements, war damage and theft. The war damage to Angkor Wat's temples however has been very limited, compared to the rest of Cambodia's temple ruins, and it has also received the most attentive restoration. [35] \nThe restoration of Angkor Wat in the modern era began with the establishment of the Conservation d'Angkor (Angkor Conservancy) by the  \u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise d'Extr\u00eame-Orient  (EFEO) in 1908; before that date, activities at the site were primarily concerned with exploration. [78] [79]  The Conservation d'Angkor was responsible for the research, conservation, and restoration activities carried out at Angkor until the early 1970s, [80]  and a major restoration of Angkor was undertaken in the 1960s. [81] \nWork on Angkor was abandoned during  the Khmer Rouge era  and the Conservation d'Angkor was disbanded in 1975. [82]  Between 1986 and 1992, the  Archaeological Survey of India  carried out restoration work on the temple, [83]  as France did not recognise the Cambodian government at the time. Criticisms have been raised about both the early French restoration attempts and particularly the later Indian work, with concerns over damage done to the stone surface by the use of chemicals and cement. [35] [84] [85] \nIn 1992, following an appeal for help by  Norodom Sihanouk , Angkor Wat was listed in UNESCO's  World Heritage in Danger  (later removed in 2004) and  World Heritage Site  together with an appeal by UNESCO to the international community to save Angkor. [86] [87]  Zoning of the area was set up to protect the Angkor site in 1994, [88]   APSARA  was established in 1995 to protect and manage the area, and a law to protect Cambodian heritage was passed in 1996. [89] [90] \nA number of countries such as France, Japan and China are currently involved in various Angkor Wat conservation projects. The  German Apsara Conservation Project  (GACP) is working to protect the  devatas , and other bas-reliefs which decorate the temple, from damage. The organisation's survey found that around 20% of the devatas were in very poor condition, mainly because of natural erosion and deterioration of the stone but in part also due to earlier restoration efforts. [91]  Other work involves the repair of collapsed sections of the structure, and prevention of further collapse: the west facade of the upper level, for example, has been buttressed by scaffolding since 2002, [92]  while a Japanese team completed restoration of the north library of the outer enclosure in 2005. [93] \nMicrobial biofilms have been found degrading sandstone at Angkor Wat, Preah Khan, and the Bayon and West Prasat in Angkor. The dehydration- and radiation-resistant filamentous cyanobacteria can produce organic acids that degrade the stone. A dark filamentous fungus was found in internal and external  Preah Khan  samples, while the alga  Trentepohlia  was found only in samples taken from external, pink-stained stone at Preah Khan. [94]  Replicas have been made to replace some of the lost or damaged sculptures. [95] \nSince the 1990s, Angkor Wat has become a major tourist destination. In 1993, there were only 7,650 visitors to the site; [96]  by 2004, government figures show that 561,000 foreign visitors had arrived in Siem Reap province that year, approximately 50% of all foreign tourists in Cambodia. [97]  The number reached over a million in 2007, [98]  and over two million by 2012. [99]  Most visited Angkor Wat, which received over two million foreign tourists in 2013, [100]  and 2.6 million by 2018. [101] \nThe site was managed by the private  SOKIMEX  group between 1990 and 2016, [102]  which rented it from the  Cambodian government . The influx of tourists has so far caused relatively little damage, other than some  graffiti ; ropes and wooden steps have been introduced to protect the bas-reliefs and floors, respectively. Tourism has also provided some additional funds for maintenance\u2014as of 2000 approximately 28% of ticket revenues across the whole  Angkor  site was spent on the temples\u2014although most work is carried out by teams sponsored by foreign governments rather than by the Cambodian authorities. [103] \nSince Angkor Wat has seen significant growth in tourism throughout the years,  UNESCO  and its International Co-ordinating Committee for the Safeguarding and Development of the Historic Site of Angkor (ICC), in association with representatives from the Royal Government and  APSARA , organised seminars to discuss the concept of \"cultural tourism\". [104]  Wanting to avoid commercial and mass tourism, the seminars emphasised the importance of providing high-quality accommodation and services in order for the Cambodian government to benefit economically, while also incorporating the richness of Cambodian culture. [104]  In 2001, this incentive resulted in the concept of the \"Angkor Tourist City\" which would be developed with regard to traditional Khmer architecture, contain leisure and tourist facilities, and provide luxurious hotels capable of accommodating large numbers of tourists. [104] \nThe prospect of developing such large tourist accommodations has encountered concerns from both APSARA and the ICC, claiming that previous tourism developments in the area have neglected construction regulations and more of these projects have the potential to damage landscape features. [104]  Also, the large scale of these projects have begun to threaten the quality of the nearby town's water, sewage, and electricity systems. [104]  It has been noted that such high frequency of tourism and growing demand for quality accommodations in the area, such as the development of a large highway, has had a direct effect on the underground water table, subsequently straining the structural stability of the temples at Angkor Wat. [104] \nLocals of Siem Reap have also voiced concern that the charm and atmosphere of their town have been compromised in order to entertain tourism. [104]  Since this local atmosphere is the key component to projects like Angkor Tourist City, the local officials continue to discuss how to successfully incorporate future tourism without sacrificing local values and culture. [104] \nAt the  ASEAN  Tourism Forum 2012, it was agreed that  Borobudur  and Angkor Wat would become sister sites and the provinces sister provinces. [105] \nIn 2020, the  COVID-19 pandemic  led to  travel restrictions  being introduced across the world, which had a severe impact on Cambodia's tourism sector. As a result, visitors to Angkor Wat plummeted, leaving the usually crowded complex almost deserted. [106] [107] [108] \n\n"}
