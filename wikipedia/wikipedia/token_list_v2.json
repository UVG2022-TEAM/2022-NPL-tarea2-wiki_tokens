{"texto": "world trade center wtc wtc or tower refers to two buildings that have existed at the same location within the world trade center site in lower manhattan new york city the original structure part of the original world trade center was completed in and was destroyed in the september attacks in the current structure opened in may both buildings were developed by larry silverstein who holds a ground lease for the site from the port authority of new york and new jersey the original world trade center was stories tall clad in red granite masonry and occupied a trapezoidal footprint an elevated walkway spanning vesey street connected the building to the world trade center plaza the building was situated above a consolidated edison power substation which imposed unique structural design constraints when the building opened in silverstein had difficulties attracting tenants salomon brothers signed a long term lease in and became the anchor tenant of wtc on september the structure was substantially damaged by debris when the nearby north tower of the world trade center collapsed the debris ignited fires on multiple lower floors of the building which continued to burn uncontrolled throughout the afternoon the building s internal fire suppression system lacked water pressure to fight the fires the collapse began when a critical internal column buckled and triggered cascading failure of nearby columns throughout which was first visible from the exterior with the crumbling of a rooftop penthouse structure at pm this initiated progressive collapse of the entire building at pm according to fema while the nist study placed the final collapse time at pm the collapse made the old world trade center the first steel skyscraper known to have collapsed primarily due to uncontrolled fires construction of the new world trade center began in and was completed in the building is stories tall plus one underground floor making it the th tallest in new york it is built on a smaller footprint than the original and is bounded by greenwich vesey washington and barclay streets on the east south west and north respectively a small park across greenwich street occupies space that was part of the original building s footprint the current building s design emphasizes safety with a reinforced concrete core wider stairways and thicker fireproofing on steel columns it also incorporates numerous green design features the building was the first commercial office building in new york city to receive the u s green building council s leadership in energy and environmental design leed certification where it won a gold rating it was also one of the first projects accepted to be part of the council s pilot program for leadership in energy and environmental design core and shell development leed cs the original world trade center was a story building designed by emery roth sons with a red granite facade the building was feet m tall with a trapezoidal footprint that was ft m long and ft m wide tishman realty construction managed construction of the building the ground breaking ceremony was hosted on october the building opened in may becoming the seventh structure of the world trade center world trade center was constructed above a two story con edison substation that had been located on the site since the substation had a caisson foundation designed to carry the weight of a future building of stories containing sq ft m however the final design for world trade center was for a much larger building than originally planned when the substation was built xxxviii the structural design of world trade center therefore included a system of gravity column transfer trusses and girders located between floors and to transfer loads to the smaller foundation existing caissons installed in were used along with new ones to accommodate the building the th floor functioned as a structural diaphragm providing lateral stability and distribution of loads between the new and old caissons above the th floor the building s structure was a typical tube frame design with columns in the core and on the perimeter and lateral loads resisted by perimeter moment frames a shipping and receiving ramp which served the entire world trade center complex occupied the eastern quarter of the world trade center footprint the building was open below the rd floor providing space for truck clearance on the shipping ramp the spray on fireproofing for structural steel elements was gypsum based monokote which had a two hour fire rating for steel beams girders and trusses and a three hour rating for columns mechanical equipment was installed on floors four through seven including transformers on the th floor several emergency generators installed in the building were used by the new york city office of emergency management salomon smith barney and other tenants in order to supply the generators gallons l of diesel fuel were stored below ground level diesel fuel distribution components were located at ground level up to the ninth floor after the world trade center bombings of february new york city mayor rudy giuliani decided to situate the emergency command center and associated fuel tanks at world trade center although this decision was criticized in light of the events of the fuel in the building is today not believed to have contributed to the collapse of the building the roof of the building included a small west penthouse and a larger east mechanical penthouse each floor had sq ft m of rentable office space which made the building s floor plans considerably larger than most office buildings in the city in all world trade center had sq ft m of office space two pedestrian bridges connected the main world trade center complex across vesey street to the third floor of world trade center the lobby of world trade center held three murals by artist al held the third circle pan north xii and vorces vii in june before construction was completed developer larry silverstein signed drexel burnham lambert as a tenant to lease the entire world trade center building for billion over a term of years in december after the boesky insider trading scandal drexel burnham lambert canceled the lease leaving silverstein to find other tenants spicer oppenheim agreed to lease percent of the space but for more than a year as black monday and other factors adversely affected the lower manhattan real estate market silverstein was unable to find tenants for the remaining space by april he had lowered the rent and made other concessions in november salomon brothers withdrew from plans to build a large new complex at columbus circle in midtown instead agreeing to a year lease for the top floors of world trade center the building was extensively renovated in to accommodate salomon brothers and world trade center alternatively became known as the salomon brothers building most of the three existing floors were removed as tenants continued to occupy other stories and more than tons u s of steel were added to construct three double height trading floors nine diesel generators were installed on the th floor as part of a backup power station essentially salomon is constructing a building within a building and it s an occupied building which complicates the situation said a district manager of silverstein properties according to larry silverstein the unusual task was possible because it could allow entire portions of floors to be removed without affecting the building s structural integrity on the assumption that someone might need double height floors at the time of the september attacks salomon smith barney was by far the largest tenant in world trade center occupying sq ft m percent of the building which included floors other major tenants included itt hartford insurance group sq ft m american express bank international sq ft m standard chartered bank sq ft m and the securities and exchange commission sq ft m smaller tenants included the internal revenue service regional council sq ft m and the united states secret service sq ft m the smallest tenants included the new york city office of emergency management national association of insurance commissioners federal home loan bank of new york first state management group inc provident financial management and the immigration and naturalization service the department of defense dod and central intelligence agency cia shared the th floor with the irs the clandestine cia office was revealed only after the attacks floors were mechanical floors as were the bottom six floors and part of the seventh floor as the north tower collapsed on september heavy debris hit world trade center damaging the south face of the building pdf p and starting fires that continued to burn throughout the afternoon the collapse also caused damage to the southwest corner between floors and and on the south face between floor and the roof other possible structural damage included a large vertical gash near the center of the south face between floors and the building was equipped with a sprinkler system but had many single point vulnerabilities for failure the sprinkler system required manual initiation of the electrical fire pumps rather than being a fully automatic system the floor level controls had a single connection to the sprinkler water riser and the sprinkler system required some power for the fire pump to deliver water additionally water pressure was low with little or no water to feed sprinklers after the north tower collapsed some firefighters entered world trade center to search the building they attempted to extinguish small pockets of fire but low water pressure hindered their efforts over the course of the day fires burned out of control on several floors of world trade center the flames visible on the east side of the building during the afternoon the fire was also seen on floors and pdf p in particular the fires on floors through and through continued to burn out of control during the afternoon at approximately pm firefighters noticed a bulge in the southwest corner of world trade center between the th and th floors a sign that the building was unstable and might collapse during the afternoon firefighters also heard creaking sounds coming from the building around pm fdny chief of operations daniel a nigro decided to halt rescue operations surface removal and searches along the surface of the debris near world trade center and evacuate the area due to concerns for the safety of personnel the fire expanded the girders of the building causing some to lose their structural integrity this led column number a critical column supporting a large part of the th floor to buckle causing the floors above it to collapse to the fifth floor however this could not be seen from outside the building the structure also developed cracks in the facade just before the entire building started to fall according to fema this collapse started at pm edt when the east mechanical penthouse started crumbling differing times are given as to what time the building completely collapsed at pm edt according to fema and at pm edt according to nist there were no casualties associated with the collapse nist found no evidence to support conspiracy theories such as the collapse being the result of explosives it found that a combination of factors including physical damage fire and the building s unusual construction set off a chain reaction collapse in may the federal emergency management agency fema issued a report on the collapse based on a preliminary investigation conducted jointly with the structural engineering institute of the american society of civil engineers under the leadership of dr w gene corley p e fema made preliminary findings that the collapse was not primarily caused by actual impact damage from the collapse of wtc and wtc but by fires on multiple stories ignited by debris from the other two towers that continued burning unabated due to lack of water for sprinklers or manual firefighting the report did not reach conclusions about the cause of the collapse and called for further investigation subsequently the national institute of standards and technology nist was authorized to lead an investigation into the structural failure and collapse of the world trade center twin towers and world trade center the investigation led by dr s shyam sunder drew upon in house technical expertise as well as the knowledge of several outside private institutions including the structural engineering institute of the american society of civil engineers sei asce the society of fire protection engineers sfpe the national fire protection association nfpa the american institute of steel construction aisc the council on tall buildings and urban habitat ctbuh and the structural engineers association of new york seaony the bulk of the investigation of world trade center was delayed until after reports were completed on the twin towers in the meantime nist provided a preliminary report about wtc in june and thereafter released occasional updates on the investigation according to nist the investigation of world trade center was delayed for a number of reasons including that nist staff who had been working on world trade center were assigned full time from june to september to work on the investigation of the collapse of the twin towers in june shyam sunder explained we are proceeding as quickly as possible while rigorously testing and evaluating a wide range of scenarios to reach the most definitive conclusion possible the wtc investigation is in some respects just as challenging if not more so than the study of the towers however the current study does benefit greatly from the significant technological advances achieved and lessons learned from our work on the towers in november nist released its final report on the causes of the collapse of world trade center this followed nist s august draft report which included a period for public comments and was followed in by a peer reviewed summary in the journal of structural engineering in its investigation nist utilized ansys to model events leading up to collapse initiation and ls dyna models to simulate the global response to the initiating events nist determined that diesel fuel did not play an important role nor did the structural damage from the collapse of the twin towers or the transfer elements trusses girders and cantilever overhangs the lack of water to fight the fire was an important factor the fires burned out of control during the afternoon causing floor beams near column to expand and push a key girder off its seat triggering the floors to fail around column on floors to with a loss of lateral support across nine floors column buckled pulling the east penthouse and nearby columns down with it with the buckling of these critical columns the collapse then progressed east to west across the core ultimately overloading the perimeter support which buckled between floors and causing the remaining portion of the building above to fall down as a single unit the fires which were fueled by office contents and burned for hours along with the lack of water were the key reasons for the collapse at the time this made the old wtc the only steel skyscraper to have collapsed from fire when wtc collapsed debris caused substantial damage and contamination to the borough of manhattan community college s fiterman hall building located adjacent at west broadway to the extent that the building was not salvageable a revised plan called for demolition in and completion of the new fiterman hall in at a cost of million the verizon building an art deco building located directly to the west had extensive damage to its eastern facade from the collapse of world trade center though it was later restored at a cost of us billion files relating to numerous federal investigations had been housed in world trade center the equal employment opportunity commission estimated over of its cases were affected investigative files in the secret service s largest field office were lost with one secret service agent saying all the evidence that we stored at world trade in all our cases went down with the building copies of emails in connection with the worldcom scandal that were later requested by the sec from salomon brothers a subsidiary of citigroup housed in the building were also destroyed the nist report found no evidence supporting the conspiracy theories that world trade center was brought down by controlled demolition specifically the window breakage pattern and blast sounds that would have resulted from the use of explosives were not observed the suggestion that an incendiary material such as thermite was used instead of explosives was considered unlikely by nist because of the building s structural response to the fire the nature of the fire and the unlikelihood that a sufficient amount of thermite could be planted without discovery based on its investigation nist reiterated several recommendations it had made in its earlier report on the collapse of the twin towers it urged immediate action on a further recommendation that fire resistance should be evaluated under the assumption that sprinklers are unavailable and that the effects of thermal expansion on floor support systems be considered recognizing that current building codes are drawn to prevent loss of life rather than building collapse the main point of nist s recommendations was that buildings should not collapse from fire even if sprinklers are unavailable the new world trade center has stories and is ft m tall the building has floors of leasable space starting at the th floor and a total of million sq ft m of office space the first ten floors house an electrical substation which provides power to much of lower manhattan the office tower has a narrower footprint at ground level than did its predecessor so the course of greenwich street could be restored to reunite tribeca and the financial district the original building on the other hand had bordered west broadway on the east necessitating the destruction of greenwich street between barclay street and the northern border of the world trade center superblock david childs of skidmore owings and merrill worked in conjunction with glass artist and designer james carpenter to create a design that uses ultra clear low iron glass to provide reflectivity and light with stainless steel spandrels behind the glass to help reflect sunlight stainless steel used in the building facade is molybdenum containing type which provides improved resistance to corrosion to enclose the power substation and improve its aesthetics the base of the building has a curtain wall with stainless steel louvers that provide ventilation for the machinery during the day the curtain wall reflects light while at night it is illuminated with blue led lights the curtain wall around the lobby uses heavily laminated heat strengthened glass that meets high standards for blast resistance at night a large cube of light above the lobby also emanates blue light while during the day it provides white light to the lobby and at dusk it transitions to violet and back to blue inside the main lobby artist jenny holzer created a large light installation with glowing text moving across wide plastic panels the entire wall which is ft m wide and ft m tall changes color according to the time of day holzer worked with klara silverstein the wife of larry silverstein to select poetry for the art installation the wall is structurally fortified as a security measure the building is being promoted as the safest skyscraper in the u s according to silverstein properties the owner of the building it incorporate s a host of life safety enhancements that will become the prototype for new high rise construction the building has foot thick m reinforced concrete and fireproofed elevator and stairway access shafts the original building used only drywall to line these shafts the stairways are wider than in the original building to permit faster egress world trade center is equipped with otis destination elevators after pressing a destination floor number on a lobby keypad passengers are grouped and directed to specific elevators that will stop at the selected floor there are no buttons to press inside the elevators this system is designed to reduce elevator waiting and travel times the elevator system is integrated with the lobby turnstile and card reader system that identifies the floor on which a person works as he or she enters and can automatically call the elevator for that floor nearly percent of structural steel used in the building consists of recycled steel rainwater is collected and used for irrigation of the park and to cool the building along with other sustainable design features the building is designed to allow in plenty of natural light power is metered to tenants to encourage them to conserve energy the heating steam is reused to generate some power for the building and recycled materials are used for insulation and interior materials the construction phase of the new world trade center began on may with the installation of a fence around the construction site tishman construction corporation of new york began work at the new world trade center in soon after the site was cleared of debris restoring the con ed electrical substation was an urgent priority to meet power demands of lower manhattan because world trade center is separate from the main acre ha world trade center site larry silverstein required approval from only the port authority and rebuilding was able to proceed quickly building seven was not included in the original world trade center master plan by daniel libeskind but was designed by skidmore owings merrill under the leadership of david childs who largely redesigned one world trade center once construction of the power substation was completed in october work proceeded on building the office tower an unusual approach was used in constructing the building erecting the steel frame before adding the concrete core this approach allowed the construction schedule to be shortened by a few months construction was completed in at a cost of million though silverstein received million from insurance on the old building he owed more than million on its mortgage costs to rebuild were covered by million in liberty bonds which provide tax exempt financing to help stimulate rebuilding in lower manhattan and insurance money that remained after other expenses a sq ft m triangular park was created between the extended greenwich street and west broadway by david childs with ken smith and his colleague annie weinmayr of ken smith landscape architect the park comprises an open central plaza with a fountain and flanking groves of sweetgum trees and boxwood shrubs at the center of the fountain sculptor jeff koons created balloon flower red whose mirror polished stainless steel represents a twisted balloon in the shape of a flower the building was officially opened at noon on may with a free concert featuring suzanne vega citizen cope bill ware vibes brazilian girls ollabelle pharaoh s daughter ronan tynan of the irish tenors and special guest lou reed prior to opening in march the new world trade center frontage and lobby were used in scenes for the movie perfect stranger with halle berry and bruce willis since the building opened several unleased upper floors have been used for events such as charity lunches fashion shows and black tie galas silverstein properties allowed space in the new building to be used for these events as a means to draw people to see the building from september to october the work of photographer jonathan hyman was displayed in an american landscape a free exhibit hosted by the world trade center memorial foundation at world trade center the photographs captured the response of people in new york city and across the united states after the september attacks the exhibit took place on the th floor while space remained available for lease by march percent of the building had been leased in september moody s signed a year lease to rent floors of world trade center other tenants that had signed leases in world trade center as of may included abn amro ameriprise financial inc law firm wilmerhale darby darby p c mansueto ventures llc business publisher of fast company and inc and the new york academy of sciences the space occupied by mansueto ventures has been designed to use the maximum amount of natural light and has an open floor plan the space used by the new york academy of sciences on the th floor designed by h hardy collaboration architecture works with the parallelogram shape of the building keeping with the green design of the building the nyas uses recycled materials in many of the office furnishings has zoned heating and cooling and motion detecting lights which activate automatically when people are present and adjust according to incoming sunlight silverstein properties also has offices and the silver suites executive office suites in world trade center along with office space used by the architectural and engineering firms working on world trade center greenwich street greenwich street and greenwich street the building became fully leased in september when msci was reported to have leased a square

{"texto": "belton house is a grade i listed country house in the parish of belton near grantham in lincolnshire england built between and by sir john brownlow rd baronet it is surrounded by formal gardens and a series of avenues leading to follies within a larger wooded park belton has been described as a compilation of all that is finest of carolean architecture the only truly vernacular style of architecture that england had produced since the tudor period it is considered to be a complete example of a typical english country house for about three centuries until belton house was the seat successively of the brownlow family which had first acquired land in the area in the late th century and of its heirs the cust family in created earl brownlow despite his great wealth sir john brownlow rd baronet chose to build a comparatively modest house rather than one of the grand baroque palaces being built by others at the time the contemporary if provincial carolean style was the selected choice of design the new house was fitted with the latest innovations such as sash windows for the principal rooms and more significantly with completely separate areas for the staff successive generations made changes to the interior of the house which reflected their changing social position and tastes yet the fabric and design of the house changed little following world war i the custs like many previously wealthy english families were faced with mounting financial problems and finally in they donated the house with most of its contents to the national trust which now opens belton to the public the brownlow family a dynasty of lawyers began accumulating land in the belton area from approximately in they acquired the reversion of the manor of belton itself from the pakenham family who finally sold the manor house to sir john brownlow i in king james had stayed a night as a guest of sir henry pakenham in the old house in march on his way to scotland the old house was situated near the church in the garden of the present house and remained largely unoccupied since the family preferred their other houses elsewhere john brownlow had married an heiress but was childless he became attached to two of his more distant blood relations a great nephew also called john brownlow and a great niece alice sherard the two cousins married each other in when both were aged three years later the couple inherited the brownlow estates from their great uncle together with an income of ps per annum about ps million in present day terms and ps in cash equivalent to about ps million now they immediately bought a town house in the newly fashionable southampton square in bloomsbury and decided to build a new country house at belton work on the new house began in the architect thought to have been responsible for the initial design is william winde although the house has also been attributed to sir christopher wren while others believe the design to be so similar to roger pratt s clarendon house london that it could have been the work of any talented draughtsman the assumption popular today that winde was the architect is based on the stylistic similarity between belton and coombe abbey which was remodelled by winde between and further evidence is a letter dated in which winde recommends a plasterer who worked at belton to another of his patrons whoever the architect belton follows closely the design of clarendon house completed in this great london town house demolished c has been one of the most admired buildings of its era due to its elegant symmetry and confident and common sensical design sir john summerson described clarendon house as the most influential house of its time among those who aimed at the grand manner and belton as much the finest surviving example of its class john and alice brownlow assembled one of the finest teams of craftsmen available at the time to work on the project this dream team was headed by the master mason william stanton who oversaw the project his second in command john thompson had worked with sir christopher wren on several of the latter s london churches while the chief joiner john sturges had worked at chatsworth under william talman the wrought ironworker john warren worked under stanton at denham place buckinghamshire and the fine wrought iron gates and overthrow at belton may be his thus so competent were the builders of belton that winde may have done little more than provide the original plans and drawings leaving the interpretation to the on site craftsmen this theory is further demonstrated by the external appearance of the adjoining stable block more provincial and less masterful in proportion it is known to have been entirely the work of stanton the late th century in england was a time of great progress in design following the austere years of commonwealth rule a great flourishing and development in both architecture and the arts began after the restoration of the monarchy in royalist exiles and wealthy young men who made the grand tour returned home with new ideas often extravagant variations on classical themes this was for england the dawn of the baroque era the new wave of architects such as roger pratt john webb and sir christopher wren were not just building vast edifices in renaissance inspired styles but also transforming existing older houses representative of the utilisation of older houses is coleshill house in berkshire where pratt transformed the medieval but now redundant great hall into a classically inspired entrance hall complete with an imperial staircase great halls were considered redundant now that employers wished to live separately from their servants and no longer ate with them in a great hall all evidence and odours of cooking and staff were banished from the principal parts of the house employers began to live in fine airy rooms above the ground floor with privacy from their servants who were now confined unless required to specifically delegated areas often the ground and uppermost attic floors this was a period of great social change in british history and the educated prided themselves on enlightenment and elegance belton was designed in the restrained almost palladian inspired architecture of the time immediately before the full emergence in england of the ornate baroque the general form this architecture took was of severely symmetrical often rectangular houses with a pediment over the central bays this almost rigid concept was to influence the design of innumerable houses including belton later to be known as the carolean style from carolus the latin name for the reigning monarch charles ii it was popular with the minor aristocracy and gentry for both their town and country houses until long after charles ii s death belton is faced with the local ancaster stone with a lighter ashlar from ketton for the quoining the h shaped plan was a design which became popular in the late elizabethan period however by the late th century domestic architecture had evolved further than the one room deep ranges of the earlier h plan houses such as montacute house the new layout placed rooms back to back creating a house two rooms deep this became known as double pile as at belton this permitted rooms to be not just better lit and heated but also better accessed and related to each other and with the greatest advantage of all greater privacy on the construction side the double room depth allowed the house to be more compact and under one more easily constructed roof thus lowering building costs the plan of the rooms at belton was passe for a grand house of its time following the restoration and the influx of european ideas it had become popular for large houses to follow the continental fashion of a suite of state rooms consisting of a withdrawing room dressing room and bedroom proceeding from either side of a central saloon or hall these rooms were permanently reserved for use by a high ranking guest such as a visiting monarch while belton does have a saloon at its centre enfilades of state rooms of lessening grandeur do not flank it the possible reason for this unusual layout is that while the brownlows possessed great wealth their title was only a baronetcy and their fortune was barely a century old they would have been regarded as gentry not aristocracy as a result building a suite of state rooms would have been in hope rather than anticipation of a royal guest however the lack of a fashionable and formal suite of state apartments coupled with the brownlows lack of social credentials did not prevent a visit from king william iii to the newly completed house in the king occupied the best bedchamber a large room with an adjoining closet directly above the saloon that led directly from the second floor great dining chamber this design followed the older style of having reception rooms and bedrooms scattered over the two main floors the layout used followed roger pratt s theory that guest and family rooms should be quite separate as a consequence of this philosophy the family occupied the rooms on the first and second floors of the west and east wings with the state rooms in the centre the great staircase designed to be grand and imposing rose to the east side of the house and formed part of the guest s state route from the hall and saloon on the first floor to the principal dining room and bedroom on the second the principal entrance hall reception and family bedrooms were placed on the ground and first floors above a low semi basement containing service rooms the two principal entrances to the mansion in the centre of both the north and south facades were accessed by external staircases originally a single flared flight on the north side and a double staircase on the south each of which have since been replaced by single broad flights of steps the second floor has a matching fenestration with windows of equal value to those on the first floor below the very latest innovation sash windows was used on both floors the semi basement and attic storey used the more old fashioned mullioned and transomed windows indicating the lower status of the occupants of these floors it was clearly emphasised from without that the two main floors of the house were purely for state and family use and the staff and service areas were confined to the semi basement and attic floors this concept of keeping staff and domestic matters out of sight when not required was relatively new and had first been employed by pratt in the design of coleshill house in berkshire the contemporary social commentator of the day roger north lauded back stairs of which belton has two examples and on plan as one of the most important inventions of his day the principal room is the large marble hall at the centre of the south front this hall is the beginning of a grand procession of rooms and corresponds to the former great parlour or saloon on the north front the marble hall is flanked by the former little parlour now the tapestry room and the great staircase while the saloon is flanked by two withdrawing rooms the bedrooms are arranged in individual suites on both floors of the two wings etc that flank the state centre of the house the main staircase set to one side of the marble hall is one of the few things at belton which is asymmetrically placed it has a robust plaster work ceiling incorporating the brownlow crest by the london plasterer edward goudge now looked on as ye best master in england in his profession william winde reported in bodily and spiritual needs were balanced symmetrically within the mansion the kitchen and the chapel were both large two storied halls rising from the semi basement to the first floor this design not only provided a great and lofty space but also allowed the servants to worship in the chapel without leaving the service floor while their employers would worship from a private gallery complete with fireplace overlooking the chapel on the first floor one of the most carolean features of the house is the balustrade and cupola surmounting the roof another element introduced to english architecture by roger pratt the cupola at belton does not light a lofty domed hall as is often the case in europe but houses a staircase which gives access to a large viewing platform on top of a lead roof concealed from the ground by the balustrade which tops the more conventional and visible hipped roof from this vantage point the owners of belton could admire the perfect symmetry of their avenues and formal gardens spreading from the house this feature of the house was removed by the architect james wyatt when he modernised the house in the th century it was restored to its original form in the s by the rd earl brownlow some of belton s many rooms have been altered over the last years both in use and design one of the principal rooms the marble hall the first of the large reception rooms serves as an entrance hall from the south entrance and takes its name from a chequer board patterned floor of black and white marble tiles by the time of belton s conception the great hall was no longer a place for the household to eat but intended as a grand entrance to the house the hall was originally hung with portraits of kings queens and emperors from william the conqueror to william iii intended to give the house an air of dynastic importance the less numerous and far newer brownlow family portraits were originally hung in the great dining room immediately above the room is fully panelled and parts of the panelling contain lime wood embellishments attributed to grinling gibbons in the early th century this room and some others were re modelled by jeffry wyatville who in addition to graining and painting the panelling to imitate oak installed new doors the second of the principal reception rooms the saloon opens from the marble hall this large panelled room is on an axis to the avenues of the formal north gardens originally known as the great parlour this has always been the chief reception room of the house it retains its original marble fireplace and has an ornate plaster ceiling which is a victorian copy of the original ceiling by the carolean plasterer edward goudge the centrepiece of the room is a large aubusson carpet made in for the st earl brownlow either side of the saloon are two smaller drawing rooms which would originally have served as private withdrawing rooms from the more public activities which would have taken place in the marble hall and saloon one of these rooms now called the tyrconnel room was transformed into the principal or state bedroom during the occupancy of lord tyrconnel in an attempt to create a more fashionable suite of baroque state rooms on the first floor after his death in it became a billiard room until the rd earl brownlow had it refurnished more than a century later unusually the floor is painted with the family arms and crest the date of the floor is not known for certain but the early nineteenth century has been suggested the final large reception room on the first floor is the hondecoeter room so named because of the three huge oil paintings by melchior d hondecoeter depicting scenes of birds in courtyards which are fitted into the neo carolean panelling the panelling was introduced to the room by the rd earl brownlow in when it was furnished as the principal dining room of the mansion the room was initially created as a library in from the upper part of the earlier kitchen which had originally risen two stories the west staircase was originally a service stairs and would have been plainer in decor but by the late nineteenth century it was in regular use by the family either side of the marble hall lie the great staircase and the tapestry room which contains a collection of early eighteenth century mortlake tapestries the great staircase to the east of the marble hall is unusually placed at belton as in a house of this period one would expect to find the staircase in the hall the stairs rise in three flights around the west north and east walls to the former great dining room above the marble hall thus the staircase served as an important state procession link between the three principal reception rooms of the house the great dining room now the library has been greatly altered and all traces of carolean decoration removed first by james wyatt in when it was transformed into a drawing room with a vaulted ceiling and again in when its use was again changed this time to a library the room contains some volumes a superb example of book collecting over years when lord tyrconnel died in a catalogue of his library identified almost books almost all of these remain in the belton library today rupert gunnis attributed the carved marble chimneypiece depicting two roman goddesses to sir richard westmacott leading from the library is the queen s room the former best bed chamber this panelled room was redecorated in for the visit of queen adelaide widow of william iv when its former function as a state bedroom was resurrected it contains the great canopied rococo style bed in which the queen slept complete with the royal monogram ar adelaide regina embroidered on the bedhead other rooms on the second floor are mostly bedrooms which include the chinese room directly above the tyrconnel room with its original hand painted th century chinese wallpaper the yellow room directly above the blue room and the windsor bedroom directly above the school room so called following its use by king edward viii of the united kingdom who became the duke of windsor after the abdication crisis of edward visited belton in the s with his mistress wallis simpson and the th baron brownlow was heavily involved in the crisis thanks to his position as the king s lord in waiting today belton has a permanent exhibition devoted to that event another royal visitor charles prince of wales also used the room frequently while a cadet at nearby raf cranwell in sir john brownlow was granted permission to enclose an area of acres km to transform into a park with a grant to keep deer there is evidence to suggest that some of this area had been a park since at least the park was laid out with avenues including the still surviving eastern avenue which led east from the house brownlow also had a large pond or lake dug and planted ash trees oak trees and fruit trees it is thought that william winde may have advised on the layout of the gardens closer to the house were a series of more formal gardens including canal ponds bordered by plantations containing symmetrical walks resembling the rond points circular clearings in a garden from which straight paths radiate introduced by the landscape gardener andre le notre by the end of the eighteenth century these formal parterres had been removed and the canal ponds filled in sir john brownlow was succeeded at belton by his brother who was content to permit brownlow s widow alice to remain in occupation she spent the remainder of her life at belton arranging advantageous marriages for her five daughters on her death in the house passed to her husband s nephew and her son in law sir john brownlow iii later viscount tyrconnel tyrconnel a dilettante of no great intellect was responsible for many of the architectural features which survive in the park and garden between and a series of follies including a gothic ruin a cascade and a prospect or belvedere known as the belmount tower were constructed for him when built the tower had two small wings flanking each side since removed john cust st earl brownlow owner of belton house from to commissioned the architect anthony salvin to undertake improvements to the estate in salvin s additions included a public house estate cottages a hermitage and the boathouse in belton was inherited by sir john cust the son of previous owner viscount tyrconnel s widowed sister cust was a distinguished politician active during the politically turbulent s and his monument at belton blames his death at the age of to the unusual fatigues of his office his heir was created lord brownlow in and belton was owned by successive lords brownlow for the next years in the last three decades of the th century the rd earl brownlow spent much time and money restoring belton and consequently the house entered the th century in a good state of repair and preservation however the th century was to present belton and its estate with serious problems these included the introduction of income tax and death duties which would leave the finances of the brownlow family severely depleted at the beginning of world war i like many other british landowners the rd earl brownlow offered his house and park to the government for war service the offer was accepted and the largest and most drastic changes were made in the park since the time of viscount tyrconnel s folly building in august the house and park were used as the assembly point for the th northern division before its deployment in the home depot and training ground of the machine gun corps were established in the southern part of belton park the lie of the land there where the river witham passes between the lower lincolnshire limestone and the upper lias mudstone lent itself to the development of the necessary firing ranges close to good communications by way of the great north road and grantham railway station on the east coast main line the depot was closed in the site cleared and the land restored to lord brownlow in little sign of the machine gun corps s stay remains in the park but plaques and inscriptions can be followed from the south gate of belton park to the memorial gate on the way from there to the town centre and in the north aisle of grantham parish church this was the subject for an episode of time team season episode the forgotten gunners of wwi belton again saw war service during world war ii from part of the royal air force regiment was housed in nissen huts at the park in a facility named raf belton park the years following world war i were severely testing for the owners of many great estates the staff both indoor and outdoor which had previously been plentiful essential and cheap were now in short supply millions of men had left private service to join the army and very few returned female domestic staff had been called up for war service in factories and now realised there was an easier and better paid existence outside of the gates of the great country houses belton house remained relatively untouched during this period largely owing to the failing fortunes of the brownlow family the rd earl brownlow and his countess lived for only a few months of the year at belton where they came for the fox hunting and divided the remainder of their time between their house in london and ashridge another country house in hertfordshire ashridge a huge gothic revival pile had come to the brownlows in the th century through the egerton family it was sold with its art collection and furnishings to pay the death duties arising on the death of the rd earl in hence belton became the brownlows sole country home further death duties were incurred in on the death of the rd earl s successor his second cousin adelbert cust th baron brownlow in the ensuing period many thousands of country houses of great architectural value were demolished or had whole wings razed to the ground in alone one house was demolished every five days in this respect belton was fortunate to survive at all as in addition to the family s problems the house deteriorated to such an extent that in the th baron employed the architect francis johnson to oversee a large restoration program lasting three years not only was the roof repaired but much of the panelling taken down and repaired and new cornices installed also attempts were made to curtail serious infestations of dry rot the seventh baron attempted to retain the house and estate by opening to the public an adventure playground was built in the nearby woods to attract families to the house as a tourist attraction however the financial difficulties were too great and in january he transferred ownership of the house garden and some of the contents to the national trust a charitable body experienced in the management of historic properties an auction of the contents was held at belton house by christie s over three days april may comprising lots the national trust then purchased at a cost of ps million worth about ps million today acres km of parkland and much of the remaining contents with a grant from the national heritage memorial fund the trust quickly produced a guide book for the season and opened to the public a priority was the establishment of a restaurant which would not only augment the estate s income but also encourage people to spend more time at belton and travel greater distances to visit though the house its contents and outbuildings were in an adequate state of repair at the time of the gift they have since become part of an ongoing programme of conservation and restoration at the same time the national trust has introduced new features and attractions such as a silver exhibition that displays a collection of silver amassed by the brownlow family dating from further revenue is raised from the use of the property as a filming location and from licensing the marble hall for civil weddings the house features in the bbc s adaptation of moondial and also as rosings park in the bbc s television version of pride and prejudice it was visited by people during until its acceptance by the national trust belton house was always in the ownership of the family of its builder though the failure of three generations to produce a son and heir caused the ownership to pass sideways and sometimes through the female line the owners of belton are buried in the village of belton s parish church close to the house their tombs are collectively one of the most complete sets of family memorials in england continuous generation to generation for almost years the earliest brownlow buried here is the founder of the family fortune

{"texto": "the benty grange helmet is an anglo saxon boar crested helmet from the th century ad it was excavated by thomas bateman in from a tumulus at the benty grange farm in monyash in western derbyshire the grave had probably been looted by the time of bateman s excavation but still contained other high status objects suggestive of a richly furnished burial such as the fragmentary remains of a hanging bowl the helmet is displayed at sheffield s weston park museum which purchased it from bateman s estate in the helmet was constructed by covering the outside of an iron framework with plates of horn and the inside with cloth or leather the organic material has since decayed it would have provided some protection against weapons but was also ornate and may have been intended for ceremonial use it was the first anglo saxon helmet to be discovered with five others found since sutton hoo coppergate wollaston shorwell and staffordshire the helmet features a unique combination of structural and technical attributes but contemporaneous parallels exist for its individual characteristics it is classified as one of the crested helmets used in northern europe from the th to th centuries ad the most striking feature of the helmet is the boar at its apex this pagan symbol faces towards a christian cross on the nasal in a display of syncretism this is representative of th century england when christian missionaries were slowly converting anglo saxons away from traditional germanic paganism the helmet seems to exhibit a stronger preference toward paganism with a large boar and a small cross the cross may have been added for talismanic effect the help of any god being welcome on the battlefield the boar atop the crest was likewise associated with protection and suggests a time when boar crested helmets may have been common as do the helmet from wollaston and the guilden morden boar the contemporary epic beowulf mentions such helmets five times and speaks of the strength of men when the hefted sword its hammered edge and gleaming blade slathered in blood razes the sturdy boar ridge off a helmet the benty grange helmet was made by covering an iron frame with horn it probably weighed about kg lb the weight of the weston park museum s replica the framework which now exists in sixteen corroded fragments originally consisted of seven iron strips each between and millimetres thick a brow band cm in long and cm in wide encircled the head two strips of the same width ran from front to back and from side to side the cm in long nose to nape band extended cm in in the front and cm in in the back the extension over the nose was straight whereas the extension at the back was curved inwards so as to fit the nape of the wearer the lateral band ran from ear to ear both ends are broken off slightly below the brow band but it would have extended further as part of a cheek or ear protection it was affixed to the outside of the dexter wearer s right side of the brow band the inside of the sinister wearer s left side and the outside of the nose to nape band the four quadrants created by this configuration were each subdivided by a narrower subsidiary strip of iron only one of which now survives each subsidiary strip was attached to the outside of the brow band cm in from the centre of the lateral band here they were mm in wide and while tapering towards a width of mm in rose at a deg angle towards the lateral band which they overlapped at a deg angle just beneath the crest the inside of the helmet was most likely originally lined with leather or cloth since decayed eight plates of horn probably softened and bent and suggested to be from cattle note were cut to fit the eight spaces created by the iron frame no horn now survives but mineralized traces on the iron strips preserve the grain pattern the plates were fitted over the iron thereby hiding it and abutted at the centre of each strip the joins were hidden by further pieces of horn that were cut to the width of the iron strips and placed on top the three layers iron at the bottom followed by two layers of horn were held together by a succession of rivets iron rivets placed from inside the helmet and rivets made of or coated in silver with ornamental heads in the shape of a double headed axe placed from the outside cm in apart traces of horn on the rear extension of the nose to nape band and on the rear brow band suggest that the material was also used for a neck guard these suggest that pieces of horn extending cm in from the centre of the brow band to the bottom of the rear nose to nape band would have met each extension of the lateral band at a deg angle reaching them cm in from the centre of the brow band in addition to the aesthetic elements incorporated into the basic construction of the helmet two features provide added decoration a cross on the nasal and a boar on the crest the silver cross is cm in long by cm in wide and consists of two parts a silver strip was added underneath elongating what was originally an equal armed cross it was placed atop a layer of horn and attached to the helmet with two rivets one at the intersection of the two arms and one at the bottom around the cross in a zigzag pattern are twenty nine silver studs out of a suggested original forty that were probably tapped into small holes drilled or bored into the horn the most distinctive feature of the benty grange helmet is its boar affixed to the apex of the helmet the core of its body is made of two pieces of hollow d sectioned bronze tubes their flat sides approximately mm in apart the space between the two halves was filled in with a substance likely horn or metal which has now disintegrated it perhaps projected upwards forming the mane or spine of the boar or as has been interpreted on the replica created a recess into which a mane of actual boar bristles could fit on either side of the bronze core was affixed a plate of iron forming the visible exterior of the boar four pear shaped plates of gilded silver cut down and filed from roman silver as evidenced by a classical leaf design on the reverse of the front left plate and file marks on the obverse acted as hips through which passed two silver rivets one atop the other per end these rivets held together the five layers of the boar and were welded to the plates into the body of the boar were placed holes probably punched that held circular silver studs approximately mm in in diameter the studs likely flush with the surface of the body were filed down and gilded and may have been intended to represent golden bristles eyes were formed with mm in long pointed oval garnets set into gold sockets with filigree wire edging the sockets were mm in long by mm in wide and had mm in long shanks filled with beeswax sunk into the head individual pieces of gilded bronze seem to have formed the tail tusks muzzle jawline and ears of the boar but few traces of them now remain two sets of iron legs probably solid originally but rendered hollow by corrosion attached the body to an elliptical bronze plate both sets depict front legs bent forwards without account for the anatomical differences between a boar s fore and hind limbs the elliptical plate is cm in long with a maximum width of cm in and matches the curvature of the helmet four holes indicate attachment points for the legs and another three connected the plate to the frame of the helmet in addition to a large rivet hole slightly behind the centre the plate was probably affixed directly to the frame the legs passing through holes in the horn the benty grange helmet would have both offered some protection if worn in battle and indicated its wearer s status as the weston park replica shows it would have originally been an impressive object and may have been intended for ceremonial use experiments using a mockup of the replica also showed that the helmet would have resisted blows with an axe which damaged the horn without entirely breaking it arrows and spears pierced the horn but they also pierced modern fibreglass and safety helmets helmets were rare in anglo saxon england and the benty grange helmet both by its richness and its scarcity signified the high status of its owner such protection certainly seems to have been among the armour of the affluent in the contemporary epic beowulf a poem about kings and nobles they are relatively common while the helmeted vendel and valsgarde graves from the same period in sweden thought to be the burials of wealthy non royals suggest that helmets were not solely for the use of the elite yet thousands of furnished anglo saxon graves have been excavated since the start of the th century and helmets remain rare this may partly reflect poor rates of artefact survival or even recognition but their extreme scarcity indicates that they were never deposited in great numbers the helmet was discovered in a barrow on the benty grange farm in derbyshire in what is now the peak district national park thomas bateman an archaeologist and antiquarian who led the excavation note described benty grange as a high and bleak situation its barrow which still survives is prominently located by a major roman road now the a possibly to display the burial to passing travellers it may have also been designed to share the skyline with two other nearby monuments arbor low stone circle and gib hill barrow the seventh century peak district was a small buffer state between mercia and northumbria occupied according to the tribal hidage by the anglo saxon pecsaete the area came under the fold of the mercian kingdom around the eighth century the benty grange and other rich barrows suggest that the pecsaete may have had their own dynasty beforehand but there is no written evidence for this bateman excavated the barrow on may although he did not mention it in his account he was likely not the first person to dig up the grave the fact that the objects were found in two clusters separated by ft m and that other objects that normally accompany a helmet were absent such as a sword and shield suggests that the grave had previously been looted being so large it may alternatively or additionally have contained two burials only one of which was discovered by bateman the barrow comprises a circular central mound approximately m ft in diameter and m ft high an encircling fosse about m ft wide and m ft deep and outer penannular earthworks around m ft wide and m ft high the entire structure measures approximately by m by ft bateman suggested a body once lay at its centre flat against the original surface of the soil what he described as the one remnant strands of hair is now thought to be from a cloak of fur cowhide or something similar the recovered objects were found in two clusters one cluster was found in the area of the supposed hair the other about ft m to the west in the former area bateman described a curious assemblage of ornaments which were difficult to remove successfully from the hardened earth this included a cup identified as leather but probably of wood approximately in cm in diameter at the mouth its rim was edged with silver while its surface was decorated by four wheel shaped ornaments and two crosses of thin silver affixed by pins of the same metal clenched inside also found were the remnants of three hanging bowl escutcheons as well as a knot of very fine wire and some thin bone variously ornamented with lozenges c attached to silk but that soon decayed when exposed to air approximately ft m to the west of the other objects was found a jumbled mass of ironwork separated this mass included a collection of chainwork a six pronged piece of iron resembling a hayfork and the helmet as bateman described it the helmet has been formed of ribs of iron radiating from the crown of the head and covered with narrow plates of horn running in a diagonal direction from the ribs so as to form a herring bone pattern the ends were secured by strips of horn radiating in like manner as the iron ribs to which they were riveted at intervals of about an inch and a half all the rivets had ornamented heads of silver on the outside and on the front rib is a small cross of the same metal upon the top or crown of the helmet is an elongated oval brass plate upon which stands the figure of an animal carved in iron now very much rusted but still a very good representation of a pig it has bronze eyes there are also many smaller decorations abounding in rivets which have pertained to the helmet but which it is impossible to assign to their proper places as is also the case with some small iron buckles bateman closed his account of the excavation by noting the particularly corrosive nature of the soil which by he said has generally been the case in tumuli in derbyshire he suggested that this was the result of a mixing or tempering with some corrosive liquid the result of which is the presence of thin ochrey veins in the earth and the decomposition of nearly the whole of the human remains bateman s friend llewellynn jewitt an artist and antiquarian who frequently accompanied bateman on excavations painted four watercolours of the finds parts of which were included in bateman s account note this was more than jewitt produced for any other of their excavations a mark of the importance that they assigned to the benty grange barrow the helmet entered the extensive collection of bateman where it attracted interest on october he related his discoveries including the helmet to the british archaeological association and in it was catalogued along with other objects from the benty grange barrow in bateman died at and in his son thomas w bateman loaned the objects to sheffield they were displayed at the weston park museum through at which time the museum purchased objects including the helmet from the family other pieces were dispersed elsewhere as of the helmet remains in the collection of the museum from november to march it joined the coppergate helmet at the british museum for the making of england anglo saxon art and culture ad the benty grange barrow was designated a scheduled monument on october the list entry notes that a lthough the centre of benty grange barrow has been partially disturbed by excavation the monument is otherwise undisturbed and retains significant archaeological remains it goes on to note that further excavation would yield new information the nearby farm was renovated between and as of it is rented out as a holiday cottage in the helmet was brought to the british museum to undergo cleaning and study permission to carry out the work had been requested the previous year when rupert bruce mitford recently returned from world war ii service in the royal signals to an assistant keepership at the museum spent time in sheffield examining the benty grange grave goods a letter from t d kendrick to bruce mitford s army camp had assigned him his position and responsibility for the sutton hoo discoveries brace yourself for the task the letter concluded upon his return he therefore took to studying the comparison material his work in included the excavation of the valsgarde boat grave in sweden alongside sune lindqvist and the trip to sheffield intended to shed light on the sutton hoo helmet through comparison with the only other anglo saxon helmet then known permission was obtained from the curator and trustees of the weston park museum for the proposed work and by february when shortly before the centennial of its excavation bruce mitford exhibited it to the society of antiquaries of london the benty grange helmet was brought to london work at the british museum was overseen by keeper of the research laboratory harold plenderleith who in some cases particularly with the boar did the work himself additional input was provided by bruce mitford the technical attache and authority on ancient metalwork herbert maryon and the archaeologist and art historian francoise henry in the hundred years following its exposure to the air the helmet had continued to corrode and certain parts had become indiscernible the boar was unrecognizable and the silver rivets and cross were almost completely obscured a strong needle was used to pick off the encrustation revealing the underlying features during this process the boar hitherto thought solid snapped in two bruce mitford termed this occurrence fortunate for it revealed the boar s inner structure frederic charles fraser examined the remnants of horn at the natural history museum and conducted experiments softening and shaping modern horn the benty grange helmet is dated to the first half of the th century ad on the basis of its technical construction and decorative style it is one of six anglo saxon helmets joined by the subsequent discoveries from sutton hoo york wollaston shorwell and staffordshire these are all other than the frankish shorwell helmet examples of the crested helmets known in northern europe in the th through th centuries ad such helmets are characterized by prominent crests and rounded caps traits shared by the benty grange example and other than a viking age fragment found in kiev uniformly originate from england or scandinavia contemporary continental helmets were primarily spangenhelm or lamellenhelm the ultimate form of the helmet is unparalleled among surviving anglo saxon and crested helmets although individual characteristics are shared while other anglo saxon helmets were typically formed with wide perpendicular bands and four infill plates note their swedish counterparts from vendel and valsgarde display similar use of thin iron frameworks the complicated construction of the benty grange boar which combines garnet filigree gold silver iron and bronze is unique across ornamental anglo saxon objects but the general boar crest is paralleled by the wollaston and guilden morden boars one other helmet exhibits the use of horn but it is the spangenhelm type helmet of a high status child discovered in cologne the helmet was made during the nascent days of christianity in anglo saxon england and exhibits both christian and pagan motifs the boar invoked a pagan tradition and the cross a christian belief roman britain had been officially converted to christianity in the fourth century although celtic paganism remained strong in the fifth century ireland was converted by british missionaries and in irish missionaries based in the monastery of iona off the western coast of scotland embarked on the conversion of the picts christianity almost disappeared in southern britain after its conquest by the pagan anglo saxons in the fifth and sixth centuries apart from the surviving celtic areas of southwest england and wales in pope gregory the great sent the gregorian mission to kent to embark on the conversion of the anglo saxons it rapidly converted kingdoms as far north as northumbria but initial success was often followed by a period of apostasy and in several cases the final conversion was carried out by irish missionaries from iona it is not known whether the pecsaete were converted by adherents of the roman or irish celtic tradition the benty grange helmet was made during this time of change as evidenced by its syncretic display it emphasises the pagan element a large boar dominating a small cross the cross may not necessarily be an indication of christian belief it may have instead been chosen for its amuletic effect whatever the politics behind religious conversion the battlefield was not a place to discriminate against gods"},
{"texto": "the acra also spelled akra from ancient greek akra hebrew khqr khqrh haqra h with the meaning of stronghold see under etymology was a place in jerusalem thought to have had a fortified compound built by antiochus epiphanes ruler of the seleucid empire following his sack of the city in bce the name acra was also used at a later time for a city quarter probably associated with the by then destroyed fortress known in his time to josephus st century ce as both acra and the lower city the fortress played a significant role in the events surrounding the maccabean revolt which resulted in the formation of the hasmonean kingdom the upper city was captured by judas maccabeus with the seleucid garrison taking refuge in the acra below and the task of destroying this last enemy stronghold inside jerusalem fell to simon maccabeus surnamed thassi our knowledge about the acra is based almost exclusively on the writings of josephus which are of a later date and on the first and second books of maccabees which were written not long after the described events the exact location of acra within jerusalem and even the meaning of the term fortress fortified compound inside the city or compound with an associated fortress is critical to understanding hellenistic jerusalem but it remains a matter of ongoing discussion the fact that josephus has used the name interchangeably with the lower city certainly doesn t help historians and archaeologists have proposed various sites around jerusalem relying initially mainly on conclusions drawn from literary evidence this approach began to change in the light of excavations which commenced in the late s new discoveries have prompted reassessments of the ancient literary sources jerusalem s geography and previously discovered artifacts the more recent theories combine archaeological and textual evidence and favour locations near the temple mount and south of it but there are alternative theories as well see location the ancient greek term acra was used to describe other fortified structures during the hellenistic period the acra is often called the seleucid acra to distinguish it from references to the ptolemaic baris as an acra and from the later city quarter of jerusalem which inherited the name acra acra is the shortened form of the greek loanword akropoli adopted in aramaic usage and having the connotation of citadel or stronghold here are the events leading up to the maccabean revolt in which the acra played an important role based again mainly on josephus antiquities of the jews and the first and second book of maccabees following alexander the great s death in bce judea was contested between the ptolemaic kingdom in egypt and the seleucid empire based in syria and mesopotamia seleucid emperor antiochus iii s victory over egypt in the battle of panium brought judea under seleucid control the jewish population of jerusalem had aided antiochus during his siege of the baris the fortified base of jerusalem s egyptian garrison their support was rewarded with a charter affirming jewish religious autonomy including barring foreigners and impure animals from the temple s precincts and an allocation of official funds for the maintenance of certain religious rituals in the temple despite being allowed religious freedom many jews were enticed by and adopted elements of the prestigious and influential greek lifestyle the imperial culture offered a route to political and material advancement and this led to the formation of hellenistic elites among the jewish population hellenization produced tensions between observant jews and their brethren who had assimilated greek culture antiochus iv epiphanes ascended the seleucid throne in bce shortly afterward epiphanes was petitioned by jason for appointment to the position of high priest of israel an office occupied by his brother onias iii jason himself thoroughly hellenized furthermore promised to increase the tribute paid by the city and to establish within it the infrastructure of a greek polis including a gymnasium and an ephebion jason s petition was granted yet after a month rule he was ousted by antiochus and forced to flee to ammon in the meantime antiochus iv had launched two invasions of egypt in bce and again in bce and routed the ptolemaic armies antiochus victories were short lived his intent to unify the seleucid and ptolemaic kingdoms alarmed the rapidly expanding roman state which demanded that he withdraw his forces from egypt with antiochus engaged in egypt a false rumor spread in jerusalem that he had been killed in the ensuing uncertainty jason gathered a force of followers and attempted to take jerusalem by storm although the attack was repulsed when word of the fighting reached antiochus in egypt he suspected his judean subjects of exploiting his setback as an opportunity to revolt in bce antiochus iv epiphanes marched on and sacked jerusalem looting the temple treasury and killing thousands of its residents reversing his father s policy antiochus iv issued decrees outlawing traditional jewish rites and persecuting observant jews temple rituals were discontinued jewish observance of sabbath prohibited and circumcision outlawed to consolidate his hold on the city monitor events on the temple mount and safeguard the hellenized faction in jerusalem antiochus stationed a seleucid garrison in the city then they fortified the city of david with a great strong wall and strong towers and it became their citadel and they stationed there a sinful people lawless men these strengthened their position they stored up arms and food and collecting the spoils of jerusalem they stored them there and became a great snare it became an ambush against the sanctuary an evil adversary of israel continually the name acra derived from the greek acropolis and signified a lofty fortified place overlooking a town in jerusalem the word came to symbolize anti jewish paganism a fortress of the impious and wicked dominating both the city and the surrounding countryside it was occupied not only by a greek garrison but by their jewish confederates as well the seleucid suppression of jewish religious life met with considerable resistance among the native population while antiochus was occupied in the east during bce a rural priest mattathias of modiin raised a rebellion against the empire both the seleucid administration and the local hellenized faction failed to grasp the magnitude of the revolt in bce judas maccabaeus liberated jerusalem and reconsecrated the temple although the surrounding city had fallen the acra and its inhabitants held out maccabaeus besieged the fortress whose inhabitants sent an appeal to the seleucid king now antiochus v for assistance a seleucid army was dispatched to put down the revolt when it laid siege to beth zur maccabaeus was forced to abandon his siege of the acra and face antiochus in battle in the subsequent battle of beth zechariah the seleucids won their first victory over the maccabees and maccabaeus was forced to withdraw spared from capitulation the acra persisted as a seleucid stronghold for more years during which it weathered several hasmonean attempts to oust the greek garrison judas was killed in bce and succeeded by his brother jonathan who attempted to build a barrier to cut off the acra s supply line jonathan had already assembled the manpower required for the task when he was forced to confront the invading army of seleucid general diodotus tryphon at beth shan scythopolis having invited jonathan to a friendly conference tryphon had him seized and murdered jonathan was succeeded by another brother simon who besieged and finally captured the acra in bce two sources provide information about the ultimate fate of the acra although their accounts are contradictory in places according to josephus simon razed the acra after ousting its inhabitants and then quarried the hill on which it had stood to render it lower than the temple purge the city of its evil memory and deny it to any future occupier of jerusalem the account appearing in maccabees paints a different picture and simon decreed that every year they should celebrate this day with rejoicing he strengthened the fortifications of the temple hill alongside the citadel greek acra and he and his men dwelt there thus in this version simon did not immediately demolish the acra but instead had it occupied and may even have resided within it himself maccabees does not mention its ultimate fate the fortress had been built as an internal checkpoint to monitor and control jerusalem and its population if situated in the city of david as most scholars agree its location would have added very little to jerusalem s defenses against external threats it may have fallen out of use and been dismantled around the end of the nd century bce following the construction of the hasmonean baris and hasmonean palace in jerusalem s upper city bezalel bar kochva offers a different theory the acra was still standing in bce when antiochus vii sidetes demanded it back from simon along with jaffa and gezer two hellenized cities simon had captured simon was willing to discuss the two cities but made no mention of the acra it was at this point that he must have sealed its fate as a way to deny the seleucids any future claim or hold on jerusalem thus when antiochus vii subdued the city during hyrcanus i s reign each and every one of his demands were met except the one demanding the stationing of a seleucid garrison in the city hyrcanus may have been able to reject and antiochus to drop this demand because there was nowhere to billet the garrison as the acra would no longer have been standing this explanation places the razing of the acra somewhere in the s bce josephus describes acra or the lower city during the outbreak of the first jewish roman war he makes known the internecine struggle between two jewish factions the one led by john of gischala who controlled the temple mount and part of the lower city including the ophel and the kidron valley and the other led by simon bar giora who controlled all of the upper city where he made his place of residence in the phasael tower before abandoning it and part of the lower city acra as far as the great wall in the kidron valley and the fountain of siloam eventually when the roman army took the lower city acra they set fire to all its houses the palace of the adiabene queen helena the proselytess to judaism was formerly situated in the middle of acra the location of the original fortified structure known as acra is important for understanding how events unfolded in jerusalem during the struggle between maccabean and seleucid forces this has been the subject of debate among modern scholars since the mid s the search has focused on three areas south of the presumed location of the second temple now marked by the dome of the rock these are from north to south the area later covered by the herodian extension of the temple esplanade the ophel and the entire southeast hill known as the city of david with a fortress at its northern end complicating things is the fact that josephus acra can be understood both as the name of a fortified structure and as that of a residential area in jerusalem during his time the late second temple period named after the stronghold this area he also calls the lower city and corresponds today with parts of silwan including the city of david and is distinct from the upper market hebrew shvq h lyvn also known as the upper city as well as from the newer suburb known as bezetha new city josephus tells us that the area known as acra ancient greek akra was built on a hill in the shape of a horned moon the valley of the cheesemakers the tyropoeon separated its hill from the adjacent area known to josephus as the upper city the most detailed ancient description of the nature and location of the acra is found in josephus antiquities of the jews where it is described as residing in the lower city upon a hill overlooking the temple enclosure and when he had overthrown the city walls he built a citadel greek acra in the lower part of the city for the place was high and overlooked the temple on which account he fortified it with high walls and towers and put into it a garrison of macedonians however in that citadel dwelt the impious and wicked part of the multitude from whom it proved that the citizens suffered many and sore calamities the location of the lower part of the city elsewhere referred to as the lower city at the time of josephus st century ce is accepted to be jerusalem s south eastern hill the original urban center traditionally known as the city of david lying to the south of the temple mount however the area exposed today is significantly lower than the mount itself the top of the mount is approximately metres ft above the ground level at the southern retaining wall of the later herodian era expansion of the temple enclosure the elevation decreases to the south of this point josephus a native of jerusalem would have been well aware of this discrepancy yet is nevertheless able to explain it away by describing how simon had razed both the acra and the hill on which it had stood archaeological research south of the temple mount however has failed to locate any evidence for such large scale quarrying on the contrary excavations in the region have uncovered substantial evidence of habitation from the beginning of the first millennium bce down to roman times casting doubt on the suggestion that during hellenistic times the area was significantly higher than it was at the time of josephus or that a large hill had been cleared away this had led many researchers to disregard josephus account and his placing of the acra and suggest several alternate locations since when edward robinson proposed the area near the church of the holy sepulchre as the site of the acra at least nine different locations in and around the old city of jerusalem have been put forward the available sources do indicate the acra stood south of the temple and because maccabees is a contemporaneous account of the maccabean revolt its account of the acra is considered the most reliable josephus provides an unlikely account of the razing of a hill on which the acra had stood yet his description of the end of the great revolt ce provides additional evidence for it being located south of the temple mount but on the next day they set fire to the repository of the archives to acra to the council house and to the place called ophlas at which time the fire proceeded as far as the palace of queen helena which was in the middle of acra as the other buildings mentioned in the account all stood to the south in the lower city this also places the acra there this account attests to the persistence of the name acra in this part of jerusalem many years after hellenistic rule ended and its citadels had been overthrown and it can also be seen as referring not to a distinct building but rather to an entire region of the city indeed several clauses in maccabees may be read as making a similar point about five hundred men of the army of nicanor fell and the rest fled into the city of david and in his days things prospered in his hands so that the gentiles were put out of the country as were also the men in the city of david in jerusalem who had built themselves a citadel greek acra from which they used to sally forth and defile the environs of the sanctuary and do great damage to its purity these suggest that after the sacking of jerusalem by antiochus iv in bce at least part of the city of david to the south of the temple mount was rebuilt as a fortified hellenistic quarter of jerusalem more than a citadel it was a macedonian colony where jewish renegades and supporters of the new regime lived this is also supported by archaeological evidence including rhodian amphorae handles and box graves found on the eastern slope of the city of david the latter are dated to the early nd century ce and are uncharacteristic of second temple era jewish burial practices yet similar to other known hellenistic graveyards such as the one in acre ptolemais even if the name acra were applied to an entire hellenistic quarter rather than to just a fortress it is likely that a citadel would have stood within that compound to billet the macedonian garrison which occupied it it was normal for a hellenistic city to have a fortified stronghold at or near the highest point of its walled area thus whether a part of a larger enclave or independent of its surroundings a citadel probably did stand at the northern tip of the city of david just south of the temple mount archaeologists have tried to use finds from excavations conducted in the area to pinpoint this citadel s precise location yoram tsafrir has attempted to place the acra underneath the southeastern corner of the later herodian temple mount enclosure tsafrir points to a straight vertical seam in the enclosure s eastern masonry wall as evidence of different periods of construction north of the seam is an early section of the wall built of large ashlar blocks these blocks have faces with drafted margins around a prominent boss and are laid in homogeneous header and stretcher courses one above the other this style of construction is hellenistic and distinct from the herodian construction apparent south of the seam although the exact dating of this construction in uncertain tsafrir believes it is a remnant of the acra s foundations which were later incorporated into herod the great s extension of the temple platform as further proof tzafrir also points to a significant similarity between construction methods evident north of the seam including the use of trapezoid shaped stones with the methods employed in the seleucid city of perga in asia minor macabees attributes construction of the acra to apollonius antiochus iii s chief collector hebrew shr hmysym sar hamissim which appears to be an ancient mistranslation or his original title as chief hebrew shr sar of the mysians a people of asia minor several cisterns under the herodian temple mount extension have also been proposed as possible remnants of the seleucid citadel these include a imperial gallon l us gal cistern shaped like an e the northern edge of which is adjacent to the proposed southern line of the temple mount precinct before its herodian expansion this has been identified as the be er haqar or bor heqer mentioned in the mishnah erubin tract and commonly translated perhaps incorrectly as the cold well meir ben dov believed that the acra stood just south of the huldah gates of the southern wall of the herodian temple mount platform benjamin mazar s and excavations of the ophel the area adjoining the southern portion of the platform have unearthed the foundations of a massive structure and a large cistern both possibly dating to the hellenistic period these have been tentatively identified as remnants of the acra with the structure featuring rows of small interconnected rooms believed to be the remains of a barracks these had been demolished and built over during the hasmonean period matching the descriptions in josephus the hasmonean constructions were in turn flattened to create a public square fronting the main gates to the temple platform during the herodian renovations in november the israel antiquities authority iaa announced the possible discovery of the ancient site for the acra while excavating the givati parking lot south west of the temple mount and north west of the city of david the archaeologists doron ben ami yana tchekhanovets and salome cohen claimed that a complex of rooms and fortified walls they had unearthed was to be identified with the acra mentioned in literary sources this identification would however place it slightly south of previously suggested locations for the structure on the ophel finds include fortification walls a watchtower measuring by meters and a glacis bronze arrowheads lead sling stones and ballista stones were unearthed at the site stamped with a trident the emblem of antiochus iv epiphanes these are indicative of the military nature of the site and the efforts to take it the excavation also yielded coins from the reigns of antiochus iv through antiochus vii as well as a multitude of stamped rhodian amphora handles the givati location has been doubted by leen ritmeyer due to its being too low on the hill to overlook the temple mount as described in literary sources the acra was not the first hellenistic stronghold in jerusalem sources indicate that an earlier citadel the ptolemaic baris had also occupied a location overlooking the temple s precincts although the exact location of the baris is still debated it is generally accepted to have stood north of the temple mount on the site later occupied by the antonia fortress the baris fell to antiochus iii at the turn of the nd century bce and is absent from all accounts of the maccabean revolt despite the narratives which have the acra constructed within a very short time span it was nevertheless formidable enough to weather long periods of siege these factors coupled with references in which the baris was itself called an acra have led some to suggest that the baris and the acra were in fact the same structure although both maccabees and josephus seem to describe the acra as a new construction this may not have been the case antiquities of the jews may be translated to give the sense that the impious or wicked had remained rather than dwelt in the citadel which could be taken to mean that the acra had been standing before the revolt and that only the macedonian garrison was new koen decoster proposes that josephus wrote of a citadel in the lower part of the city to an audience that would have been familiar with the jerusalem of the st century ce a city that did feature two citadels the antonia fortress and the herodian palace as josephus roman jerusalem had already expanded to the higher western hill a citadel in the lower city could have referred to anything located east of the tyropoeon valley including the antonia which stood north of the temple and did indeed rise above and dominate it in his view this is the place josephus must have had in mind when he wrote of the acra opponents of a northern location counter that this site is not supported by the historical sources and that this would place the acra away from jerusalem s population center unlike its predecessor and successor citadels it was not meant as a defence against external threat but rather to oversee the inhabited jewish parts of the city a role incompatible with a proposed northern location several researchers have attempted to place the acra in the upper city on jerusalem s western hill within the area currently occupied by the old city s jewish quarter these propositions seek to locate the acra within antiochia the hellenistic polis established in jerusalem according to maccabees this conjectural new city would have been hippodamic in plan and therefore would have required a flat expanse of land which only the western hill could have provided furthermore the eastern edge of the hill is adjacent to the temple mount and higher in altitude two characteristics attributed to the seleucid citadel opponents of this proposed location point out that there is very little archaeological or historical evidence supporting the establishment of a hellenistic polis within jerusalem let alone sited on the western hill which appears to have been only sparsely populated during the hellenistic period excavations in today s jewish quarter display evidence of habitation from the first temple period as well as renewed hasmonean and herodian settlement but scant evidence of hellenistic occupation research into the dispersal of stamped rhodian amphorae handles has revealed that over of these handles found in jerusalem were excavated from the city of david indicating the city had not yet expanded to the western hill during seleucid rule furthermore the western hill is separated from the temple mount and the city of david by the steep tyropoeon valley a distinct tactical disadvantage for any force that may have been required to intervene in events within the temple precincts or heavily populated eastern sectors of jerusalem additional evidence for the existence of the acra may come from the chance discovery published by shimon appelbaum he of a fragmentary greek inscription in the old city of jerusalem the inscription is a fragment from the top of a sandstone stele and contains what may be an oath taken by soldiers stationed in the acra although the reading of the name acra in the text has been contested"},

wat was ordered by indra to serve as a palace for his son precha ket mealea according to the th century chinese traveller zhou daguan some believed that the temple was constructed in a single night by a divine architect the brahmin by the name of divakarapandita was responsible for urging king suryavarman ii to construct angkor wat the initial design and construction of the temple took place in the first half of the th century during the reign of suryavarman ii ruled c all of the original religious motifs derived from hinduism breaking from the shaiva tradition of previous kings angkor wat was instead dedicated to vishnu it was built as the king s state temple and capital city as neither the foundation stela nor any contemporary inscriptions referring to the temple have been found its original name is unknown but it may have been known as varah vishnu lok after the presiding deity work seems to have ended shortly after the king s death leaving some of the bas relief decoration unfinished the term vrah visnuloka or parama visnuloka literally means the king who has gone to the supreme world of vishnu which refer to suryavarman ii posthumously and intend to venerate his glory and memory in approximately years after the death of suryavarman ii angkor was sacked by the chams the traditional enemies of the khmer thereafter the empire was restored by a new king jayavarman vii who established a new capital and state temple angkor thom and the bayon respectively a few kilometers north dedicated to buddhism because the king believed that the hindu gods had failed him angkor wat was therefore also gradually converted into a buddhist site and many hindu sculptures were replaced by buddhist art towards the end of the th century angkor wat gradually transformed from a hindu centre of worship to buddhism which continues to the present day angkor wat is unusual among the angkor temples in that although it was largely neglected after the th century it was never completely abandoned fourteen inscriptions dated from the th century discovered in the angkor area testify to japanese buddhist pilgrims that had established small settlements alongside khmer locals at that time the temple was thought by the japanese visitors to be the famed jetavana garden of the buddha which was originally located in the kingdom of magadha india the best known inscription tells of ukondayu kazufusa who celebrated the khmer new year at angkor wat in one of the first western visitors to the temple was antonio da madalena a portuguese friar who visited in and said that it is of such extraordinary construction that it is not possible to describe it with a pen particularly since it is like no other building in the world it has towers and decoration and all the refinements which the

his account of this trip the people of east asia ran to six volumes when bastian finally published the studies and observations during his journey through cambodia to cochinchina in germany in told in

vivid descriptions of angkor travels in the central parts of indo china siam cambodia and laos published in through the royal geographical society there were no ordinary dwellings or houses or other signs of settlement including cooking utensils weapons or items of clothing usually found at ancient sites instead there is only evidence of the monuments themselves the artistic legacy of angkor wat and other khmer monuments in the angkor region led directly to france adopting cambodia as a protectorate on august and invading siam to take control of the ruins this quickly led to cambodia reclaiming lands in the northwestern corner of the country such as the areas of siem reap battambang and sisophon which were under siamese rule from to angkor wat s aesthetics were on display in the plaster cast museum of louis delaporte called musee indo chinois which existed in the parisian trocadero palace from c to the mid s the th century saw a considerable restoration of angkor wat gradually teams of laborers and archeologists pushed back the jungle and exposed the expanses of stone permitting the sun to once again illuminate the dark corners of the temple angkor wat caught the attention and imagination of a wider audience in europe when the pavilion of french protectorate of cambodia as part of french indochina recreated the life size replica of angkor wat during paris colonial exposition in cambodia gained independence from france on november and has controlled angkor wat since that time it is safe to say that from the colonial period onwards until the site s nomination as unesco world heritage in this specific temple of angkor wat was instrumental in the formation of the modern and gradually globalised concept of built cultural heritage restoration work was interrupted by the cambodian civil war and khmer rouge control of the country during the s and s but relatively little damage was done during this period camping khmer rouge forces used whatever wood remained in the building structures for firewood and a shoot out between khmer rouge and vietnamese forces put a few bullet holes in a bas relief far more damage was done after the wars by art thieves working out of thailand which in the late s and early s claimed almost every head that could be lopped off the structures including reconstructions the temple is a powerful symbol of cambodia and is a source of great national pride that has factored into cambodia s diplomatic relations with france the united states and its neighbour thailand a depiction of angkor wat has been a part of cambodian national flags since the introduction of the first version circa from a larger historical and even transcultural perspective however the temple of angkor wat did not become a symbol of national pride sui generis but had been inscribed into a larger politico cultural process of french colonial heritage production in which the original temple site was presented in french colonial and universal exhibitions in paris and marseille between and in december it was announced that a research team from university of sydney had found a previously unseen ensemble of buried towers built and demolished during the construction of angkor wat as well as a massive structure of unknown purpose on its south side and wooden fortifications the findings also include evidence of low density residential occupation in the region with a road grid ponds and mounds these indicate that the temple precinct bounded by moat and wall may not have been used exclusively by the priestly elite as was previously thought the team used lidar ground penetrating radar and targeted excavation to map angkor wat angkor wat is a unique combination of the temple mountain the standard design for the empire s state temples and the later plan of concentric galleries most of which were derived from religious beliefs of hinduism originally the construction of angkor wat also suggests that there was a celestial significance with certain features of the temple this is observed in the temple s east west orientation and lines of sight from terraces within the temple that show specific towers to be at the precise location of the sunrise on a solstice the temple is a representation of mount meru the home of the gods according to hindu mythology the central quincunx of towers symbolises the five peaks of the mountain and the walls and moat symbolize the surrounding mountain ranges and ocean access to the upper areas of the temple was progressively more exclusive with the laity being admitted only to the lowest level the angkor wat temple s main tower aligns to the morning sun of the spring equinox unlike most khmer temples angkor wat is oriented to the west rather than the east this has led many including maurice glaize and george coedes to conclude that suryavarman intended it to serve as his funerary temple further evidence for this view is provided by the bas reliefs which proceed in a counter clockwise direction prasavya in hindu terminology as this is the reverse of the normal order rituals take place in reverse order during brahminic funeral services archaeologist charles higham also describes a container which may have been a funerary jar which was recovered from the central tower it has been nominated by some as the greatest expenditure of energy on the disposal of a corpse freeman and jacques however note that several other temples of angkor depart from the typical eastern orientation and suggest that angkor wat s alignment was due to its dedication to vishnu who was associated with the west drawing on the temple s alignment and dimensions and on the content and arrangement of the bas reliefs researcher eleanor mannikka argues that the structure represents a claimed new era of peace under king suryavarman ii as the measurements of solar and lunar time cycles were built into the sacred space of angkor wat this divine mandate to rule was anchored to consecrated chambers and corridors meant to perpetuate the king s power and to honour and placate the deities manifest in the heavens above mannikka s suggestions have been received with a mixture of interest and scepticism in academic circles she distances herself from the speculations of others such as graham hancock that angkor wat is part of a representation of the constellation draco the oldest surviving plan of angkor wat dates to and is credited to fujiwara tadayoshi the plan is stored in the suifu meitoku kai shokokan museum in mito japan angkor wat is the prime example of the classical style of khmer architecture the angkor wat style to which it has given its name by the th century khmer architects had become skilled and confident in the use of sandstone rather than brick or laterite as the main building material most of the visible areas are of sandstone blocks while laterite was used for the outer wall and for hidden structural parts the binding agent used to join the blocks is yet to be identified although natural resins or slaked lime has been suggested the temple has drawn praise above all for the harmony of its design according to maurice glaize a mid th century conservator of angkor the temple attains a classic perfection by the restrained monumentality of its finely balanced elements and the precise arrangement of its proportions it is a work of power unity and style architecturally the elements characteristic of the style include the ogival redented towers shaped like lotus buds half galleries to broaden passageways axial galleries connecting enclosures and the cruciform terraces which appear along the main axis of the temple typical decorative elements are devatas or apsaras bas reliefs and on pediments extensive garlands and narrative scenes the statuary of angkor wat is considered conservative being more static and less graceful than earlier work other elements of the design have been destroyed by looting and the passage of time including gilded stucco on the towers gilding on some figures on the bas reliefs and wooden ceiling panels and doors the outer wall m ft by m ft and m ft high is surrounded by a m ft apron of open ground and a moat m ft wide and over kilometres mi in perimeter the moat extends kilometres from east to west and kilometres from north to south access to the temple is by an earth bank to the east and a sandstone causeway to the west the latter the main entrance is a later addition possibly replacing a wooden bridge there are gopuras at each of the cardinal points the western is by far the largest and has three ruined towers glaize notes that this gopura both hides and echoes the form of the temple proper under the southern tower is a statue known as ta reach originally an eight armed statue of vishnu may have occupied the temple s central shrine galleries run between the towers and as far as two further entrances on either side of the gopura often referred to as elephant gates as they are large enough to admit those animals these galleries have square pillars on the outer west side and a closed wall on the inner east side the ceiling between the pillars is decorated with lotus rosettes the west face of the wall with dancing figures and the east face of the wall with balustered windows dancing male figures on prancing animals and devatas including south of the entrance the only one in the temple to be showing her teeth the outer wall encloses a space of square metres acres which besides the temple proper was originally occupied by the city and to the north of the temple the royal palace like all secular buildings of angkor these were built of perishable materials rather than of stone so nothing remains of them except the outlines of some of the streets most of the area is now covered by forest a m ft causeway connects the western gopura to the temple proper with naga balustrades and six sets of steps leading down to the city on either side each side also features a library with entrances at each cardinal point in front of the third set of stairs from the entrance and a pond between the library and the temple itself the ponds are later additions to the design as is the cruciform terrace guarded by lions connecting the causeway to the central structure the temple stands on a terrace raised higher than the city it is made of three rectangular galleries rising to a central tower each level higher than the last the two inner galleries each have four large towers at their ordinal corners that is nw ne se and sw surrounding a higher fifth tower this pattern is sometimes called a quincunx and represents the mountains of meru because the temple faces west the features are all set back towards the east leaving more space to be filled in each enclosure and gallery on the west side for the same reason the west facing steps are shallower than those on the other sides mannikka interprets the galleries as being dedicated to the king brahma the moon and vishnu each gallery has a gopura at each of the points the outer gallery measures m ft by m ft with pavilions rather than towers at the corners the gallery is open to the outside of the temple with columned half galleries extending and buttressing the structure connecting the outer gallery to the second enclosure on the west side is a cruciform cloister called preah poan meaning the thousand buddhas gallery buddha images were left in the cloister by pilgrims over the centuries although most have now been removed this area has many inscriptions relating the good deeds of pilgrims most written in khmer but others in burmese and japanese the four small courtyards marked out by the cloister may originally have been filled with water north and south of the cloister are libraries beyond the second and inner galleries are connected to each other and to two flanking libraries by another cruciform terrace again a later addition from the second level upwards devatas abound on the walls singly or in groups of up to four the second level enclosure is m ft by m ft and may originally have been flooded to represent the ocean around mount meru three sets of steps on each side lead up to the corner towers and gopuras of the inner gallery the very steep stairways represent the difficulty of ascending to the kingdom of the gods this inner gallery called the bakan is a m ft square with axial galleries connecting each gopura with the central shrine and subsidiary shrines located below the corner towers the roofings of the galleries are decorated with the motif of the body of a snake ending in the heads of lions or garudas carved lintels and pediments decorate the entrances to the galleries and to the shrines the tower above the central shrine rises m ft to a height of m ft above the ground unlike those of previous temple mountains the central tower is raised above the surrounding four the shrine itself originally occupied by a statue of vishnu and open on each side was walled in when the temple was converted to theravada buddhism the new walls featuring standing buddhas in the conservator george trouve excavated the pit beneath the central shrine filled with sand and water it had already been robbed of its treasure but he did find a sacred foundation deposit of gold leaf two metres above ground level integrated with the architecture of the building and one of the causes for its fame is angkor wat s extensive decoration which predominantly takes the form of bas relief friezes the inner walls of the outer gallery bear a series of large scale scenes mainly depicting episodes from the hindu epics the ramayana and the mahabharata higham has called these the greatest known linear arrangement of stone carving from the north west corner anti clockwise the western gallery shows the battle of lanka from the ramayana in which rama defeats ravana and the battle of kurukshetra from the mahabharata showing the mutual annihilation of the kaurava and pandava clans on the southern gallery follow the only historical scene a procession of suryavarman ii then the hells and heavens of hinduism on the eastern gallery is one of the most celebrated scenes the churning of the sea of milk showing asuras and devas using the serpent vasuki to churn the sea under vishnu s direction mannikka counts only asuras and explains the asymmetrical numbers as representing the number of days from the winter solstice to the spring equinox and from the equinox to the summer solstice it is followed by vishnu defeating asuras a th century addition the northern gallery shows krishna s victory over bana where according to glaize the workmanship is at its worst angkor wat is decorated with depictions of apsaras and devata there are more than depictions of devata in the present research inventory angkor wat architects employed small apsara images cm or in as decorative motifs on pillars and walls they incorporated larger devata images all full body portraits measuring approximately cm or in more prominently at every level of the temple from the entry pavilion to the tops of the high towers in sappho marchal published a study cataloging the remarkable diversity of their hair headdresses garments stance jewellery and decorative flowers which marchal concluded were based on actual practices of the angkor period the monument was made out of five to ten million sandstone blocks with a maximum weight of tons each the entire city of angkor used far greater amounts of stone than all the egyptian pyramids combined and occupied an area significantly greater than modern day paris moreover unlike the egyptian pyramids which use limestone quarried km mi away the entire city of angkor was built with sandstone quarried km mi or more away this sandstone had to be transported from mount kulen a quarry approximately kilometres mi northeast the route has been suggested to span kilometres mi along a canal towards tonle sap lake another kilometres mi crossing the lake and finally kilometres mi against the current along siem reap river making a total journey of kilometres mi however etsuo uchida and ichita shimoda of waseda university in tokyo japan have discovered in a shorter kilometre mi canal connecting mount kulen and angkor wat using satellite imagery the two believe that the khmer used this route instead virtually all of its surfaces columns lintels and even roofs are carved there are kilometres of reliefs illustrating scenes from indian literature including unicorns griffins winged dragons pulling chariots as well as warriors following an elephant mounted leader and celestial dancing girls with elaborate hairstyles the gallery wall alone is decorated with almost m sq ft of bas reliefs holes on some of the angkor walls indicate that they may have been decorated with bronze sheets these were highly prized in ancient times and were a prime target for robbers while excavating khajuraho alex evans a stonemason and sculptor recreated a stone sculpture under metres ft this took about days to carve roger hopkins and mark lehner also conducted experiments to quarry limestone which took quarrymen days to quarry about tons of stone the labour force to quarry transport carve and install so much sandstone must have run into the thousands including many highly skilled artisans the skills required to carve these sculptures were developed hundreds of years earlier as demonstrated by some artefacts that have been dated to the seventh century before the khmer came to power as with most other ancient temples in cambodia angkor wat has faced extensive damage and deterioration by a combination of plant overgrowth fungi ground movements war damage and theft the war damage to angkor wat s temples however has been very limited compared to the rest of cambodia s temple ruins and it has also received the most attentive restoration the restoration of angkor wat in the modern era began with the establishment of the conservation d angkor angkor conservancy by the ecole francaise d extreme orient efeo in before that date activities at the site were primarily concerned with exploration the conservation d angkor was responsible for the research conservation and restoration activities carried out at angkor until the early s and a major restoration of angkor was undertaken in the s work on angkor was abandoned during the khmer rouge era and the conservation d angkor was disbanded in between and the archaeological survey of india carried out restoration work on the temple as france did not recognise the cambodian government at the time criticisms have been raised about both the early french restoration attempts and particularly the later indian work with concerns over damage done to the stone surface by the use of chemicals and cement in following an appeal for help by norodom sihanouk angkor wat was listed in unesco s world heritage in danger later removed in and world heritage site together with an appeal by unesco to the international community to save angkor zoning of the area was set up to protect the angkor site in apsara was established in to protect and manage the area and a law to protect cambodian heritage was passed in a number of countries such as france japan and china are currently involved in various angkor wat conservation projects the german apsara conservation project gacp is working to protect the devatas and other bas reliefs which decorate the temple from damage the organisation s survey found that around of the devatas were in very poor condition mainly because of natural erosion and deterioration of the stone but in part also due to earlier restoration efforts other work involves the repair of collapsed sections of the structure and prevention of further collapse the west facade of the upper level for example has been buttressed by scaffolding since while a japanese team completed restoration of the north library of the outer enclosure in microbial biofilms have been found degrading sandstone at angkor wat preah khan and the bayon and west prasat in angkor the dehydration and radiation resistant filamentous cyanobacteria can produce organic acids that degrade the stone a dark filamentous fungus was found in internal and external preah khan samples while the alga trentepohlia was found only in samples taken from external pink stained stone at preah khan replicas have been made to replace some of the lost or damaged sculptures since the s angkor wat has become a major tourist destination in there were only visitors to the
